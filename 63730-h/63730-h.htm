<p class='p2 big2 center'>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:</p>

<p>There are some characters quoted in the text that cannot be reproduced
in the text version of the book.</p>

<p>The sign ſ represents the ancient long s; the
sign [ct] represents the ct ligature and the sign [ffi] represents the
ffi ligature.</p>

<p>A number of words in this book have both hyphenated and non-hyphenated
variants. For the words with both variants present the one more used
has been kept.</p>

<p>Not all the font families used for the different articles included
in the book were availabe for the HTML version. The font families
that could be used for the transcription are Times New Roman, Gill
Sans, Garamond, Bodoni MT (instead of Bodoni Book), Baskerville,
Centaur, Perpetua and Bell. Most of the currently available browsers
are compatible with those fonts. However, it is not certain that the
currently available hand-held devices would be able to reproduce the
text with those fonts.</p>

<p>Punctuation and other printing errors have been corrected.
Nevertheless, there are some portions where the author quotes text
written in ancient style in which the punctuation rules applicable nowadays
were not followed. Those have been left unchanged.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>

<p>I am deeply grateful to many friends who have helped in the preparation
of material for this book, and have freely granted permission to reprint
their brain children.</p>

<p>To the Typophiles of New York, and to the individual authors in their
series of Chap Books, I am indebted for including: T. M. Cleland's <cite>Harsh
Words</cite>; W. A. Dwiggins' celebrated "Investigation Into the Physical
Properties of Books," first published for the Society of Calligraphers and
included in <cite>Mss. by WAD</cite>; Evelyn Harter's <cite>Printers As Men of the
World</cite>; and Lawrence C. Wroth's "First Work With American Types,"
from <cite>Typographic Heritage</cite>.</p>

<p>To the editors of <cite>The Colophon</cite>, and the three authors, I am indebted
for reprinting the essays of Earnest Elmo Calkins on "The Book and Job
Print," Ruth S. Granniss on "Colophons" and Sir Francis Meynell's
"Some Collectors Read."</p>

<p>To the individual authors, the editors of <cite>The Publishers' Weekly</cite> and
its publisher, R. R. Bowker Company, I am indebted for permission to
include W. A. Dwiggins' "Twenty Years After," the sequel to his "Investigation";
excerpts from two articles by Robert Josephy; and Will Ransom's
introduction from his <cite>Private Presses and Their Books</cite>.</p>

<p>To Beatrice Warde, who has graciously permitted reprinting her classic
"Printing Should Be Invisible."</p>

<p>I appreciate greatly the counsel of the good friends who made possible
the symposium on "The Anatomy of the Book": Peter Beilenson, Joseph
Blumenthal, P. J. Conkwright, Morris Colman, Milton Glick and Evelyn
Harter, William Dana Orcutt, Ernst Reichl, Carl Purington Rollins,
Bruce Rogers and Arthur W. Rushmore. To Mergenthaler Linotype
Company I am indebted for reprinting the text of the "Anatomy," now
slightly revised, from <cite>The Manual of Linotype Typography</cite>.</p>

<p>To both authors and their publisher, William E. Rudge's Sons, I am
indebted for including the extracts from Bruce Rogers' <cite>Paragraphs on
Printing</cite> and Merle Armitage's <cite>Notes on Modern Printing</cite>.</p>

<p>To George Macy, and the directors of the Limited Editions Club, I am
indebted for reprinting Porter Garnett's prize-winning essay, "The Ideal
Book." And also for the illustration of the punch-cutting machine (from
<cite>The Dolphin</cite>, No. 2) to accompany Carl Purington Rollins' essay,
"American Type Designers and Their Work," for which permission to
reprint was granted by R. R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Company, Chicago.</p>

<p>To my good friend, James Shand, publisher of <cite>Alphabet and Image</cite> in
London, I am indebted for including his account of George Bernard
Shaw's relations with his printer (first published in <cite>A &amp; I</cite> No. 8), and
for assistance in securing electrotypes of the illustrations.</p>

<p>To Oscar Ogg and the editors of <cite>The American Artist</cite> I owe thanks
for reprinting his "Lettering and Calligraphy," with its illustrations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[Pg vi]</span></p>

<p>To Edwin Grabhorn I am indebted for including "The Fine Art of
Printing," his address to the Roxburghe Club of San Francisco.</p>

<p>I particularly appreciate the assistance of the late Otto Ege, Mrs. Anne
Lyon Haight and Lawrence C. Wroth in revising their essays for publication
here, and the thoughtfulness of Robert Josephy, Will Ransom and
Arthur W. Rushmore in writing postscripts to enhance their essays.</p>

<p>I am thankful to Mrs. Caroline Anderson of Los Angeles; my colleague
Jackson Burke at Linotype; to Christopher Morley of Roslyn,
L. I., and Arthur W. Rushmore of Madison, N. J., for valuable suggestions
and help in research.</p>

<p>For assistance in securing illustrative material I am indebted to my
Typophile friends: John Archer, A. Burton Carnes, Lester Douglas,
George L. McKay and William Reydel. To Fred Anthoensen of Portland,
Maine, I am thankful for help in securing electrotypes to illustrate
two articles.</p>

<p>The publisher, and I as editor, acknowledge our appreciation to the
authors of the other essays included, and to their editors and publishers,
for permission to reprint this valuable material, for which detailed mention
of copyright and publication date is printed elsewhere.</p>

<p>And I hope my apologies may be accepted, should there be inadvertent
omission of appreciation to the numerous other individuals who have so
generously assisted me in preparing this book for the printer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><img src="images/flow1.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" alt="flow1" />BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION
<img src="images/flow2.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" alt="flow2" /></h2>


<p>Labeling these observations "introductory" isn't to confuse
the purist. He knows that the terms preface, foreword and introduction
become mixed frequently, he doesn't like it and he much prefers
retaining the proper distinctions.</p>

<p>"An introduction," he will insist, "should be solely concerned
with the subject of the book, and introduce or supplement its text.
And the preface or foreword should properly deal with the book's
purpose, and define its limitation and scope. Let's keep things that
way."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there isn't one term that covers comment which
flows from one division to the other in a miscellany like this. At
times&mdash;and at the risk of editorial modesty&mdash;I may seem something
of a typographic barker, singing the praises of certain essays and
pointing up different attractions. At others, the text will be supplemented
with an explanatory note, or amplified to bring it up to
date, as in the Josephy, Ransom and Rushmore articles.</p>

<p>It amounts to an assist in getting back to purpose: that of informing
on matters typographic, and on books, their printing and some
of the fascinating steps along the way. In selecting material of appeal
to the collector, printer, typographer and student, I have not overlooked
the professional curiosity of editors and technicians. That's
the thinking behind the inclusion of extracts from McKerrow and
Mores and Watson, among other scholarly contributions.</p>

<p>Where there was a choice, the preference was for the author with
a point of view and the ability to express it interestingly. Four
articles indicate this approach. "Printing, Paper and Playing Cards,"
the brilliant survey of Lancelot Hogben, illumines the birth and
spread of writing and printing as nothing else I know. Otto Ege's
brief account of the development of our alphabet, with its memorable
letter-diagrams, has a different, not less valuable appeal, as does
Oscar Ogg's comparison of "Lettering and Calligraphy," with its
specimens of his own distinguished hand. And in "Printers As Men
of the World," Evelyn Harter writes of a number of great printers
as men of intellect, at home in the world of ideas. Her stimulating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[Pg x]</span>
text suggests the compensation of looking at the background of
printing in relation to world events.</p>

<p>There was no preconceived attitude to consider in evaluating the
essays included: no restriction by country of origin; no fixation
about the traditional or modern in typographic approach; no desire
to slant, or plant, ideas; no intent other than to select much of the
best writing in English by authors of substance. That the gathering
may provide riches to be added to "the savings account of your
memory" is my hope.</p>

<p>In a quite real sense, the experience has been something like spending
many long weekends with friends in good, solid talk&mdash;some of it
controversial, much of it illuminating and informing. The re-reading
has not only opened "doors and windows for a welcome flood" of
ideas, it has suggested new trails and made for valuable comparisons
of favorites first met with years ago.</p>

<p>It has been difficult to resist the temptation to include more essays
of historic and technical appeal to typographers and printers. Many
of the present generation, I presume, may not know De Vinne's
authoritative account of the development of the American Point
System, which occurred in the late eighties and is detailed at length
in his <cite>Plain Printing Types</cite>; or the invaluable Meynell and Morison
essay on "Printer's Flowers and Arabesques," with its fascinating
reproductions, from <cite>The Fleuron</cite>. I have omitted these two with
reluctance, and have used the space they would occupy for a half-dozen
shorter essays not less worthy in themselves, but on different
topics.</p>

<p>Since space was limited, I needed to be. I would have welcomed
the opportunity to include additional essays by D. B. Updike, whose
incomparable <cite>Printing Types: Their History, Forms and Use</cite>; <cite>In
the Day's Work</cite>, and <cite>Some Aspects of Printing: Old and New</cite>, and
other writings on typography should not be missed; by W. A.
Dwiggins, the distinguished American letter artist and designer, who
writes as well as he draws; and by Holbrook Jackson, the great English
critic, literary historian and essayist, whose <cite>Anatomy of Bibliomania</cite>,
<cite>Fear of Books</cite> and <cite>Printing of Books</cite> are required reading.</p>

<p>There are other favorites omitted too, for unlike Jackson's remark
about the house of books, "There are many mansions and room
for all trades, whims, and even fads"&mdash;this book could comfortably
hold no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[Pg xi]</span></p>

<p>It has not seemed desirable, as it would be possible, to eliminate a
degree of duplication in part among some of the essays. That would
have required an amount of editorial surgery and revision unfair to
the authors concerned. More importantly, it would have assumed
that every reader would read every essay&mdash;hardly an attainable ideal.</p>

<p>Nor has any documentation been attempted to reconcile opposing
viewpoints&mdash;that of A. W. Pollard and Holbrook Jackson, for instance,
in respect to William Morris as printer and typographer.
Happy will that reader be who finds this and other instances sufficiently
provocative to embark upon further research of his own.</p>

<p>And while it is easier to come upon material in a collection such as
this than to track down each item individually, much of the fun of
the search is missing, along with the memorable thrills of discoveries
in scattered places. There's much gold yet to be found by even
moderate digging.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The greatest area for argument is that within the opposing views
of the modern and traditional approach to book design. It is unrealistic
to oppose the concept that contemporary typography should
reflect some of the differences that mark our time from other epochs.
Defining distinctions and relating them precisely to the arts of the
book is something else again.</p>

<p>In his eloquent <cite>Harsh Words</cite>, T. M. Cleland decries the restless
craving for something new. "This poison is aggravated in printing
and typography," he insists, "by the fact that of all the arts it is, by
its very nature and purpose, the most conventional. If it is an art at
all, it is an art to serve another art. It is good only so far as it serves
well and not on any account good for any other reason.</p>

<p>"It is not the business of type and printing to show off, and when,
as it so frequently does, it engages in exhibitionistic antics of its
own, it is just a bad servant.... Typography, I repeat, is a servant&mdash;the
servant of thought and language to which it gives visible existence.
When there are new ways of thinking and a new language, it
will be time enough for a new typography."</p>

<p>The modern designer disagrees. He believes books can be freshened,
made more appealing to eye and hand, and more inviting to
read, just as product-packaging has benefited by the imaginative
conceptions of skilled industrial designers. He concedes that books
remain unsurpassed as a medium for transmitting thought to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[Pg xii]</span>
reader's mind&mdash;and admits they do it best with a minimum of visual
distraction. But, he asks, "is it not reasonable to remain open-minded
and appraise the modern artist for what he may contribute?</p>

<p>"Books, to be sure, are much more than packages to be styled for
shelf attention and sparkle. Yet it seems reasonable to believe they
also may benefit by traveling the road of visual appeal and design
attractiveness, and that they may be assisted in typographic handling
to convey the author's words with a minimum of reading effort."</p>

<p>It isn't difficult to dismiss the modern approach and call it uninformed
nonsense, but that doesn't lift the curtain and illumine the
problem&mdash;or settle the continuing debate.</p>

<p>I recall discussing modern typography some years ago with the
late D. B. Updike, in his library at the Merrymount Press in Boston.
A catalog from the Museum of Modern Art was at hand, designed
by Herbert Bayer of Bauhaus fame.</p>

<p>It looked strange in its all-lower-case typography, and seemed to
slow reading because of that strangeness. To many it was the newest
of the new ... perhaps it would institute a trend? Mr. Updike smiled,
reached to a shelf for a book. It was printed more than a hundred
years earlier in Paris and set throughout in lower-case. "So far as this
had any influence, then or later," he remarked, "the experiment of
<cite>Typographie Economique</cite> is as dead as Queen Anne."</p>

<p>All of which points up Bertrand Russell's remarks, "On Being
Modern Minded," in his recent <cite>Unpopular Essays</cite><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>: "The desire to
be contemporary is new only in degree," he declares, "it has existed
to some extent in all previous periods that believed themselves to be
progressive.</p>

<p>"The Renaissance had a contempt for the Gothic centuries that
had preceded it; the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries covered
priceless mosaics with whitewash; the Romantic movement despised
the age of the heroic couplet.... But in none of these
former times was the contempt for the past nearly as complete as
it is now.</p>

<p>"From the Renaissance to the end of the eighteenth century men
admired Roman antiquity; the Romantic movement revived the
Middle Ages.... It is only since the 1914-18 war that it has become
fashionable to ignore the past <em>en bloc</em>.</p>

<p>"The belief that fashion alone should dominate opinion has great
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[Pg xiii]</span>advantages. It makes thought unnecessary, and puts the highest intelligence
within reach of everyone."</p>


<p>Really thinking through the design potential not only seems the
nub of the matter, but is basically sound typographically. Read Peter
Beilenson attentively as he discusses the amateur printer and the
development of a new style (page 313). "It is simple, but dull, to
copy an old style," he points out. "It is hard, but exciting, to work
out a new one. And while you are working at it, you must expect
cynical observers to give your experiments the adjective 'wacky';
you must expect certain curious kinds of people to praise your work
for the wrong reasons; and you must expect alternating moods of
conceit and confusion. The proofs you gloat over at night will
become commonplace by dawn....</p>

<p>"You will make misjudgments about the intelligence of ordinary
readers. You will make mistakes of taste. You will find it too easy
to get an effect by means of shock, and you will forget that any
book, even a twenty-first-century book, must be a coherent unit.
And you will often, since there are no highway markers for the
explorer, feel lonely and discouraged and want to go back to the
old familiar, well-traveled roads again....</p>

<p>"You can be subtle or bold, as you feel the urge ... you can
advance your own work by looking to other fields of creation,
enjoying and profiting by the experiments going on in them. You
can feel yourself part of the whole forward-looking culture of today
... and if you do strike a vein with the least glitter of real gold
in it, you will become rich indeed. For you will have become a
creator in a new sense; your duty done as an amateur will be compensated
with a twenty-four-carat satisfaction...."</p>

<p>There's sense in that essay, as there is in the views of Merle
Armitage, T. M. Cleland, Porter Garnett, Eric Gill, Frederic W.
Goudy, Edwin Grabhorn, Robert Josephy, Aldous Huxley, Stanley
Morison, Bruce Rogers, Carl Purington Rollins, D. B. Updike and
Beatrice Warde on related topics. Admittedly, some are in opposition&mdash;yet
that very quality of provocativeness may help in dispelling
the fog.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whether we like it or not, the factor of competition affects the
sale of books and their reading. Because so many elements compete
for reading time, we frequently forget that they comprise the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[Pg xiv]</span>
obvious: sports and the allure of the outdoors, newspapers and magazines,
the theater and movies, radio and television, as well as social
and family distractions.</p>

<p>These elements are real, measurable to a degree, and materially
affect the reading of books and consequently their sales. To the
trade publisher and printer they affect the business future and may
be considered opponents. To them, the question of whether the
modern approach is more effective than the traditional is no
academic matter.</p>

<p>We have indicated the problem at length, though only in part,
because of its consuming interest. For a comprehensive and sympathetic
account of the modern view, see <cite>Books for Our Time</cite>. That
illustrated record of the exhibition sponsored by the American Institute
of Graphic Arts (recently published by Oxford University
Press), was designed and edited by Marshall Lee, and has essays
by Merle Armitage, Herbert Bayer, John Begg, S. A. Jacobs,
George Nelson and Ernst Reichl.</p>

<p>It was Henry Watson Kent who sagely pointed out that the collector
who has affection for the book's format is not necessarily
indifferent to its soul&mdash;"the thought enshrined in it." And so, as the
one may proudly discuss his Kelmscott, Doves or Ashendene items
and their literary background, so the other&mdash;more knowledgeable in
graphic arts lore&mdash;may find equal pleasure in his discoveries: John
Winterich on Franklin as printer and publisher, possibly, or Sir
Francis Meynell on collectors who also read, or James Shand's revealing
account of G.B.S., his interest in typography and his relations
with his printers.</p>

<p>Instead of asking the fine press enthusiast to show his Doves Bible,
his B. R. <cite>Pierrot</cite>, Nonesuch Dickens, or Grabhorn <cite>Leaves of Grass</cite>,
the collector who reads about the making of books may get even
more satisfaction in discussing his favorite essays or his most recent
"find."</p>

<p>That the one can be as satisfying as the other is quite definite in
my mind. In fact, I am certain that the collector who learns to appreciate
book-making details will find the greater pleasure: his knowledge
becomes a part of him as prized items on his shelves never can;
he will enjoy looking <em>in</em> books even more than looking <em>at</em> them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A concluding typographic note: Excepting for strictly type specimen
material, and the degree of typographic expression attempted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[Pg xv]</span>
in Parts six and seven of <cite>The New Colophon</cite> for a different reason,
I don't recall any other book set in such a variety of distinguished
body types. Yet that seemed so natural and sensible an idea for this
that it has been stimulating to work it out.</p>

<p>Much of the detail and burden has fallen to the willing hands of
Joseph Trautwein, the able designer responsible for this format, and
the continuing interest of Joseph and Miriam Schwartz of Westcott
and Thomson, the superior Philadelphia typesetters, whose wealth of
typographic resources is evidenced in these pages.</p>

<p>Some of the reasons for coupling specific essays and types are
detailed in the final chapter, which includes also a brief specimen of
each face with a note on its attribution.</p>

<p>And finally, I want to salute William Targ, World's editor, for
inviting me to put this miscellany together, and for his patience in
watching the book develop. That hasn't proved anything like the
challenging experience I envisioned, but instead became a spare-time,
weekend pleasure I've enjoyed for months. Indirectly, of
course, this is related to the great fraternity of book-makers and typophiles,
rich in its friendships and international in scope, that I have
been privileged to enjoy through the years. As I scan the contents
again, I see not only the names of many good friends and the rewarding
associations they bring to mind, but also some of their best writing.
My chief regret is that there just wasn't room for more of it in
this collection. But that's a different adventure&mdash;and possibly another
book.</p>

the Origin and Significance of the Alphabet?</em></p>


<p>Our transition from barbarism to civilization can be attributed
to the alphabet. Those great prehistoric discoveries and inventions
such as the making of a fire, the use of tools, the wheel and the
axle, and even our modern marvelous applications of steam and
electricity pale into insignificance when compared with the power
of the alphabet. Simple as it now appears after the accustomed use
of ages, it can be accounted not only the most difficult, but also
the most fruitful of all the achievements of the human intellect.</p>

<p>Man lived by "bread alone" and without the alphabet untold
ages, and with a practical alphabetic system not more than 3,000
years. So important and wonderful was this step deemed by those
who lived nearer the time of its inception&mdash;in the time before the
wonder of its extraordinary powers had been blunted by long
possession and common use&mdash;that its invention, as well as that of
writing, was invariably attributed to divine origin.</p>

<p>Modern investigation always seeks sources other than mythological
ones, and thus the science of ancient hand-writing, paleography,
came into existence. In the last hundred and twenty-five
years the writing of the ancient Egyptians, which was a "sealed
book" for nearly twenty centuries, has been deciphered through
the efforts of Champollion and Young; the mysterious cuneiform
characters of ancient Assyria and Babylon have been interpreted
by Grotofend and Rawlinson, and the "missing link" to connect
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[Pg 4]</span>our present alphabetic system to these ancient ones is being partly
completed by Sir Arthur Evans, who is compiling and analyzing
Cretan characters and pre-Phoenician writing. The story, however,
will probably never be told in its entirety.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The forms of our letters, with the exception of G, J, U, W,
reached their full development two thousand years ago. The
Roman letter was the parent of all the styles notwithstanding the
diversity that has appeared in Europe since the beginning of the
Christian era. With a little imagination it is not difficult to note
the resemblance between similar letters of the old Roman capitals
and those following that have been designated as script, Italic,
Old English or black-letter, versal, uncial and an endless list of
alphabet families. The desire for speed, and the influence of the
tool, pen, reed, chisel, brush, were the determining factors in the
change of form. Curiously enough instead of being archaic, the
Roman alphabet, which is now 2,000 years old, is still the most
useful because of its legibility, and also the most beautiful.</p>

<p>We derived twenty-three of our letters from the Romans.
They had taken probably eighteen of these from the Greeks about
the fourth century <small>B.C.</small> and afterwards borrowed elsewhere or
invented seven more. Instead of giving them names as the Greeks
did, they simply called them by the sounds for which they stood:
A (ah), B (bay). They introduced the curve wherever possible,
whereas the early Greek letters were all angular&mdash;what an interesting
analogy is evident in the architecture of those two peoples,
the temple pediment and angularity of the Greeks as contrasted
with the dome and arch of the Romans.</p>

<p>The Greeks, in their contact with those great traders and
"Yankees of ancient time," the Phoenicians, saw the value of their
alphabetic writing and inaugurated its use about the time of the
first Olympiad, 776 <small>B.C.</small> Three or four centuries before they
gave it to the Romans the ancient Greeks found use for fifteen
of the Phoenician letters and then conceived enough to round
out an alphabet of twenty-four characters. The changes that took
place in the shape of their letters can be attributed to their sense
of order; the letters are balanced better and the parts better
related.</p>

<p>The Greeks were interested in the sound value only, not in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[Pg 5]</span>
the picture value of the symbol, and, therefore, they probably
did not notice that A, for instance, had ever been a picture of the
head of an ox and that it was now drawn upside down; and that
the Phoenician name "Aleph" meant ox and that they mispronounced
the sound in calling it "Alpha."</p>

<p>The Romans borrowed from the Greeks and the Greeks had
borrowed from the Phoenicians, but where did the Phoenicians
obtain their letters? Did they invent them? To what extent were
these letters influenced by earlier systems of writings as those
employed by the Cretan, Assyrian and Egyptian civilizations?
These are questions that probably will never be answered satisfactorily.
Many arguments and theories are advanced. We can,
however, trace back with certainty a number of our letters to the
Phoenician alphabet of 1000 <small>B.C.</small> Beyond this all is, at present, a
matter of conjecture.</p>

<p>The Phoenician alphabet consisted of twenty-two pictures of
familiar objects. These pictures were rudely and simply made, for
writers and readers soon recognized the fundamental characteristics
and all unnecessary details were eliminated. The great
advance that can be credited to them is that they realized that a
small number of sound-expressing characters, if well selected, are
sufficient to express any word. Other races at this period had
phonetic systems but they consisted of numerous symbols and
cumbersome appendages of non-alphabetic characters&mdash;"eye pictures"
side by side with "ear pictures." No doubt earlier Phoenician
writing passed through the stages of development traceable
in so many countries:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The pictures or characters suggesting the thing or incident
(picture writing).</p>

<p>2. The pictures or characters symbolizing the thing or idea
(ideographic or symbolic writing).</p>

<p>3. The pictures or characters representing the sound of the
thing or idea (phonograms).</p>

<p>4. The sign suggesting the various sounds of the language
(alphabetic system).</p></div>

<p>To free this last stage from the others was the great Phoenician
contribution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span></p>


<h3>A</h3>

<p>Why is A the first letter? It represents one of the commonest
vowel sounds in ancient languages. Naturally the Phoenician alphabet
makers selected a familiar object in the name of which
this particular vowel sound was emphasized. Since food is of
primal importance, it is not surprising to find that he chose the
ox&mdash;"Alef" (ah´lef), or rather the head of the ox, for the characteristics
of animals are chiefly embodied in the head. Not only
was the ox important as food but also as a beast of burden, for
the ox had been harnessed to the plow centuries before the horse
was domesticated. Thus one of the earliest and most important
of man's friends among the brute creatures was honored.</p>

<p>In making this letter repeatedly and rapidly they became careless
and instead of crossing the letter V they tried to make it with
one continuous scratching, hence when the Greeks became
acquainted with it three to five centuries after its invention, the
picture had deteriorated almost beyond recognition. They introduced
balance and the V was inverted, and the cross-bar was
retained between the lines. Unknowingly they were drawing
the ox head upside down; and it remains so with us to this day.
The Greeks called the first letter alpha, the Romans called it
A (ah) and we call it A (ay), a sound it never possessed in Latin.</p>


<h3>B</h3>

<p>The second letter of the alphabet represents a crude house,
roughly outlined. After food, shelter is an important consideration
and this fact was expressed by the early alphabet maker.
The Greeks again were ignorant of the picture and careless or
indifferent as to the exact name of the character, and thus two
triangles instead of the square supporting a triangle were made
and the name changed from "beth" to "beta" (ba´ta). Combine
the Greek names for the first two letters and we have (alphabeta)
"alphabet." The Romans shortened the name "beta," calling
it B (bay) and introduced the curved loops. The original name
is familiar to us through names found in the Scriptures: Bethel
(house of God) and Bethlehem (house of bread).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span></p>


<h3>C-G</h3>

<p>The "ship of the desert," the camel, gave its name to the third
letter. Our name for this animal is traceable back to the Phoenician
"gimel" (ghe´mel) or "gamel" (gah´mel). The long neck and
the peculiar angle of the neck in relation to the head could easily
be represented. The Greeks made changes similar to those in other
letters&mdash;they improved the shape and changed the name to
"gamma." The Romans did not forget the curve and gave it both
the hard and soft sounds (kay and gay). Later on, about the third
century <small>A.D.</small> to distinguish the "g" sound from the "k" sound
they added a little bar below the opening. Thus we get both
C and G from the picture of the camel.</p>

<p>Stevenson said that when he was a child the capital G always
impressed him as a genii swooping down to drink out of a handsome
cup. Kipling's story of the invention of the alphabet is
filled with similar delightful stories of the picture origin of letter
forms.</p>


<h3>D</h3>

<p>The next letter, D, came from a representation of a door&mdash;"daleth"
(dah´leth). It probably pictures the door of a tent. A custom
that prevails among the Arabs and in a number of countries
gave particular importance to the door of a tent&mdash;a stranger, or
even an enemy, if he entered through the door of a tent must
receive food, drink and shelter. "Daleth" became "delta" with
the Greeks and D (day) with the Romans, who, of course,
rounded the angle.</p>


<h3>E</h3>

<p>The house picture gave us B, the door, D, and the window,
E. "He" (hay) meant to look, to see, or window, and one writer
asserts our familiar street cry "hey, there" can be traced to these
ancient times. One side bar of the window was lost early.</p>

<p>The Greeks at first used this sound for the long "e" (epsilon)
but afterwards employed the character H or "eta" for the long
sound. The Romans at first made no change except to call it "eh."</p>

<p>This is the letter that occurs so frequently in English words,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
and many no doubt recall the interesting use that Poe makes of
this fact in his story "The Gold Bug."</p>


<h3>F</h3>

<p>Our letter order does not agree with that of the Phoenicians
or the early Greeks. Our sixth letter, F, is missing in classical
Greek, but it is found in earlier writings. It comes from a Phoenician
representation of a hook or nail (?) "vau." The Hebrew
form resembles the latter object. The nail was important in shipbuilding,
a common industry of the early traders. When the
Greeks used this letter they called it "digamma" (double gamma)
and its form represented one "gamma" (Greek c) superimposed
over the other. The Romans called it F (ef) and during the reign
of Emperor Claudius the consonant V was represented by the
F inverted. This was done because the Latin alphabet had but
one character to represent U and V and OCTAVIA became
OCTAℲIA.</p>


<h3>H</h3>

<p>Two fence posts and three horizontal boards gave us our
eighth letter, H. The fence was called "cheth" (haith). The
Greeks omitted the upper and lower boards thus making it like
our H, and called it "eta" (ata). The Romans gave it a soft sound
H (hah) just as we do today.</p>


<h3>I-J</h3>

<p>The parts of the human body also played an important part in
giving form to the letters of the alphabet. The early peoples
recognized the value of the hand and the head and these members
gave rise to the letters I and K, and Q and R respectively.
The hand in profile bent at the knuckles and wrist gives us the
character "yod" (the hand) as used by the Phoenicians. The
Greeks, who always liked to have their words end in vowels,
added "a" and called it "Iota" (e-o´ta). When the Romans received
it, it was simply a vertical stroke, I (ee) which represented
the same long "e" sound as it did with the Greeks, but later they
used it both as a consonant and vowel, differentiating the consonant
by making the letter I longer, J; but they did not give a
distinct letter form for the capital J until the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The small j came into being nearly a century later. The dot over
the i was first introduced in a thirteenth century manuscript.</p>

<p class="small1">(*) Until the 3rd Century <small>B.C.</small> the character <em>c</em>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span></p>
</div>


<h3>K</h3>

<p>The silhouette of the open hand, with its radiating lines, discloses
the origin of the letter K, "kaph," which signified hollow
or palm. We know that palmistry was practiced by the ancients,
and probably the association of reading the hand and writing
influenced the inclusion of this character. The Greeks added
their favorite vowel sound, "a," again and thus obtained their
"Kappa." The Romans had no need for this letter at first, as C
furnished the same sound. When they did accept it, they made
no change.</p>


<h3>L</h3>

<p>The ox goad or whip lash, "lamed" (lah´med) gave rise to the
next letter. Herding oxen and sheep was the important occupation
of the slaves of the Phoenicians and hence the last, an object
so unfamiliar to us, was easily recognized by them. The Greeks
again added an "a" and called it "lambda" and made it in the
form of an inverted V. The Romans, strangely, adhered more
closely to the original form than did the Greeks.</p>


<h3>M-N</h3>

<p>The Phoenicians were lovers of the sea, and from this source
two letters were derived, M and N. They explored not only all
of the Mediterranean shore at an early date, but they also sailed
boldly through the gates of Gibraltar, and "beyond the world"
where they found Britain. They were the first navigators that
sailed by night and it is said they discovered the north star. Therefore
it is not surprising that water "mem" (maim) is the source
of M and that fish, "nun" (noon) the source of N. The letter M
has changed but little in form, it is the Greek letter "Mu" and
the Roman M (em). The head of the fish, from which the letter
N is pictured, was simplified even more than the head of the ox,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span>
in A. It no doubt represents the fisherman's viewpoint&mdash;not a
swimming fish but a suspended one. The Greeks reversed the
stroke and called it "Nu" and the Romans did not change its
form but called it N (en).</p>


<h3>O</h3>

<p>In Phoenicia, as in Egypt, China and Mexico, the eye is one of
the commonest elements found in the writing. It was called
"Ayin" (ah-yin). The Greeks used it for two sounds now designated
by "Omicron," little "o," and "omega," great "o," the letter
which, strangely, was placed at the end of the Greek alphabet.
We find in the Bible: "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning
and the end, the first and the last." How many today
would think of using the alphabet for such an important illustration?
It is easy to trace the Roman O (oh) from its Greek parent,
"omicron."</p>


<h3>P</h3>

<p>Many letter pictures run in pairs&mdash;finger and hand, water and
fish&mdash;and now after eye we find mouth "pi" (pe) which represents
the lower lip. The Greeks made little change in the name
or shape at first, but later they introduced the angles and made
the downward strokes equal. The Romans formed the letter by
continuing the curve farther than the Phoenicians and called it
"pe" (pay).</p>


<h3>Q-R</h3>

<p>Now we come to Q and R, the letters which were mentioned
above as those probably coming from the head. Whether Q
(koph) was derived from the picture of the back view of the
head and neck, or whether it represents a knot, which, no doubt,
was as important to navigators then as it is now, is a mooted
question. The Q sound is guttural and the tail of the letter is supposed
to indicate the throat sound. The Greeks soon discarded
"koppa," as it was called, and the Romans went back to the
original source for their Q (koo).</p>

<p>The back view of the head is the unusual one, for as we look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
at the drawing of the early races, or memory pictures, or the
delineations of a child of seven or eight we find they are almost
without exception profile pictures. The Phoenician "resh" represents
the profile and shows very little resemblance to a human
being, although at first the features may have been more clearly
indicated. The Greeks, as was to be expected, turned the letter
around, and later, oddly enough, introduced a curve making it
exactly like the Roman letter P. The extra stroke which we find
in the Roman letter was no doubt due to the carelessness in copying.
They pronounced it R (air).</p>


<h3>S</h3>

<p>There is a common legend explaining S, the letter with the
hissing sound. Because of its curved shape and its hissing sound
many people believe it to be derived from a snake. Its real history
is easily followed from Phoenician "shin" or "sin" (teeth) to the
present day. Its form closely resembled our W. The Greeks made
it perpendicular for their "sigma" and the Romans simplified
and curved it giving S (ess).</p>


<h3>T</h3>

<p>Our twentieth letter, T, is particularly interesting because it
is derived from "tahv" a mark or cross made by people who
could not write, and no doubt their signature frequently resembled
it. We must not forget that even Charlemagne and other
kings of the middle ages had to make their mark or trace their
initials through stencil plates. The only change of "tahv" to
Greek "tau," and to Roman T (tay) was the raising of the cross-bar.</p>


<h3>U-V-Y</h3>

<p>The letters U, V and Y were all taken from the letter "Upsilon,"
and it may have been derived from the queer Hebrew
form of "Ayin" which closely resembles Y. The letters U and
V were interchangeable. Upsilon, known as the "Samian letter,"
was used by Pythagoras as an emblem to represent the parting
of the ways&mdash;the young man making a choice in life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span></p>


<h3>W</h3>

<p>Our Anglo-Saxon forefathers contributed two letters, W
(wen) and another often confused with Y, called "thorn." These
were introduced during the thirteenth century. The French always
called the former letter double vay, and in English it may
be said to represent double U, as its name indicates. The letter
"thorn" had the value of the digraph "th," and "ye" in old English
should be pronounced "the" like the definite article.</p>


<h3>X-Z</h3>

<p>Although we have no direct need for the letter X, for Z can
be substituted for it when it is used as an initial letter, and "ks"
when used elsewhere, it has remained in the alphabet since its
frequent use by the Greeks. It came from the Roman X (eex)
which may have been derived from the Greek "ksi." The latter
resembles the Phoenician character "samech," meaning a post or
support.</p>

<p>The dagger "zayin" from which we obtain our Z must have
been important in the daily lives of the Greeks, Hebrews and
Phoenicians for it occupies the sixth place (Zeta) and the seventh
in the latter alphabets. The Romans did not change its name or
shape, but although there has been little change in 2,000 years
we see little resemblance to the short sword in the letter the
Romans gave to us.</p>


<p>Many slight changes that have occurred in the formation of
the letters of the alphabet may be accounted for. At first the
Greeks wrote from left to right in one line and from right to
left on the next line&mdash;a mode of writing which has been termed
"boustrophedon" because it runs as an ox plow does in a field, up
one furrow and down another. It is due to this fact that many
letters were reversed from their original prototypes. It is interesting
to note that recently books for the blind have been embossed
in this manner.</p>

<p>The small letters of the alphabet, sometimes called "lower case"
letters because printers keep them in a case below the capitals, or
"minuscule letters" in contrast with "majuscule," or capital let<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>ters,
illustrate further changes due to rapid writing of capitals in a
cursive or running hand.</p>

<p>The few characters selected by the Phoenicians, the great
traders, artificers and farmers of the ancient world, not only influenced
Greek literature and life, Roman and modern nations
in Europe, but also spread eastward to the very walls of China.
The Hebrews copied them as a whole and retained the original
names with only slight variations. They did change the shapes
because a different writing instrument was employed.</p>

<p>According to a legend, Jehovah gave the letters to Moses, hence
all the left curves in Hebrew letter form turn upward&mdash;as symbols
of a finger pointing heavenward.</p>

<p>The Phoenician alphabet is also the parent of the Arabic, Indian,
Javanese, Corean, Tibetan, Coptic syllabaries and alphabets.
No small country ever gave such a great gift to humanity; no
large country could have given a greater gift.</p>

<p>Twenty thousand years or more separate the way of life of
the Aurignacian hunters, who contributed the first pictures to
the modern symposium of human communications, from the
beginnings of settled community life and the beginnings of a
priestly script. Fully three thousand years separate the way of
life of the first Semitic trading folk who had an alphabet from
the vast expansion of knowledge which occurred in Northern
Europe after the spread of printing from movable type during
the half century before the voyages of Columbus. Civilised mankind
had to surmount many hurdles before it was possible to
exploit to the fullest extent the considerable economy signalised
by the introduction of alphabetic writing.</p>

<p>At first, there were few people who had any use for the art of
writing except as a convenience of commercial intercourse. There
was in fact no incentive to adapt the art of writing with letters to
the flexible uses of daily speech.... An age-long popular tradition
of community singing and community dancing lies back of Aeschylus,
Euripides and Aristophanes; but it was one which could
assume so novel an aspect only in the trading communities of the
islands in the Mediterranean, where constant interchange of personnel
promoted conditions less propitious to the dominance of a
priestly class of avaricious landed proprietors than under the
earlier dynasties of Egypt and the near East. Thus and there, at
an early date, a segment of tribal ritual crystallises as a secular
pursuit; and where there is a flourishing drama there is also a
motive for writing, equally aloof from association with the
repetition of sacred texts or from the limited requirements of the
counting-house. There is, in fact, an incentive to write down
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span>what is more than a ceremonial password, an epitaph or a bill of
goods, an incentive to record in writing what living people actually
speak.</p>

<p>It is indeed a far cry from the Greek drama to the free-and-easy
visual speech of a modern novel or of a modern newspaper in
the Western world; but we unduly belittle our too often overrated
debt to Greek civilisation, if we fail to pay tribute to an
innovation which entitles Greek literature to rank as a cardinal
contribution to the self-education of the human species. To a
far greater extent than the Romans, the Greeks wrote about the
life of their times with an intimacy and liveliness which foreshadows
the adaptation of writing to all the familiar uses of
speech. For the Latin which generations of schoolboys reluctantly
construed in the grammar schools, Latin in the Gladstone tradition,
was actually dead when committed to writing, a language
as remote from the common speech of the Italian peninsula as the
idiom of Gertrude Stein from that of the contemporary American
household.</p>

<p>Within the framework of Greco-Latin society, the written
word became available to the more prosperous citizens on a scale
unprecedented in the civilisations which had preceded them; but
there were still very few who read much or read often. The
spoken word was still the main instrument of instruction and of
political persuasion. Even among those who could read, there
were still few who could also write. There were in fact two formidable
impediments alike to the use of the written word as a
medium of instruction or of propaganda and to the availability of
any considerable body of written matter for those with inclination
and training in the art of reading. Needless to say, one was the
laborious nature of the only available means of multiplying the
products of the pen, when it was necessary to copy every script
individually by hand; and since this was a labour commonly entrusted
to slaves, deficiency in penmanship gave little affront to
self-esteem among the still privileged few who could read with
ease. The other handicap was the writing surface itself, often of
its very nature inadaptable to free circulation and at best costly.</p>

<p><small>PAPER</small> is so much a part of every-day life that we too easily
overlook the significance of writing material as a circumstance
limiting the advancement of literacy. It is on that account worthy
of more than a single sentence. The clay tablets of Babylon and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
Crete might serve the purpose of stocking a temple or a palace
library; but no household of modest size could have accommodated
the contents of several issues of the <cite>New Yorker</cite>, if transcribed
in the cuneiform tradition. Much the same may be said
about the wax tablets in common use among the Roman contemporaries
of Cicero. Indeed the advantage Egyptian civilisation,
and thereafter the mainland Greek, Alexandrian, and late Latin,
enjoyed from the use of <em>papyrus</em> is difficult to exaggerate. Papyrus
consists of longitudinal ribbons of reed laid on a wet surface,
stuck with gum to an overlaying layer of similar strips at right
angles, dried in the sun and subsequently polished. It has a double
advantage over clay and wax. It is not bulky, and its smooth
surface permits an easy cursive style of writing. On the other
hand, its manufacture is tedious; and it does not stand up to a
moist climate.</p>

<p>Long before printing began in Europe&mdash;during the Han dynasty
in the first century <small>A.D.</small>&mdash;the Chinese had taken a lesson
from the wasp, which makes its nest by chewing vegetable fibre
and pressing the moist suspension into a film of even thickness. As
a source of vegetable fibre, the Chinese used anything which came
to hand: old fishing nets, worn-out rope and hemp, macerating
it in tubs before removing with a sieve the artificial detritus. It
is then possible to compress the latter to required thickness, and
the triturated fibres adhere when dry. The Mandarin had now
material far superior to papyrus, alike for copying or for storing
the written word; but he lacked the incentive to share the advantage
of this invention with his underprivileged compatriots.
Chinese literature received a new impetus; but there were still
few who could enjoy its benefits....</p>

<p>The capture of Samarkand by the Arabs in <small>A.D.</small>  750 marks
the date when paper starts on its trek to the as yet non-existent
printing presses of Europe. The Moslem invaders of Spain and
Sicily brought it with them into the territories they conquered,
and with it a recipe for deriving the fibre basis from old rags.
For three centuries after its introduction to Christendom, somewhere
about <small>A.D.</small> 1200, it had to compete with parchment or
vellum made from stretched, pressed and dried animal membranes.
What was probably decisive in establishing its supremacy was the
spread of water mills in the two centuries before Caxton. Power
was necessary to speed up maceration of the raw material; and we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span>
have record of paper mills in Germany by <small>A.D.</small> 1336. Had it not
been for this new tempo and economy of production of thin,
smooth and flexible material for the impress of the written word,
the vastly increased volume of written matter put into circulation
by the printing press could not have come about.</p>

<p>As we all know, printing from movable type began in Europe
about fifty-years before Columbus set out on his first voyage; but
few of us reflect upon the dramatic speed with which the new
trade spread from one city or one country to another. A single
leaf of a sibylline poem called the <cite>Fragment of World Judgment</cite>
is supposedly the earliest extant product of the new technique,
probably issued about the year 1445 from the press of Gutenberg,
a master printer, then resident in Strasbourg. From law-suit records
we know that Fust, a goldsmith of Mainz who financed
Gutenberg's earliest trials, was printing there during the fifties;
and McMurtrie, author of <cite>The Book</cite>, states that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>the first <em>dated</em> piece of printing preserved to us appeared in 1454,
which is thus the earliest date that can be set beyond any speculation
or controversy. In that year four different issues of a papal
indulgence appeared in printed form. The occasion was historic.
Constantinople had fallen to the Turks the year before. At the
solicitation of the king of Cyprus, Pope Nicholas V granted indulgences
to those of the faithful who should aid with gifts of
money the campaign against the Turks. Paulinus Chappe, as
representative of the king of Cyprus, went to Mainz to raise
money of this cause. Ordinarily, these indulgences would have
been written out by hand, but in this case, as there were a considerable
number to be distributed, the aid of the new art of
printing was enlisted, and forms were printed with blank spaces
left for filling the dates, the names of the donors to whom they
were issued, and other details.</p></div>

<p>The new art turned out to be a double-edged weapon in the
hands of papal authority. A Latin Bible in two columns of forty-two
lines to the page came out in 1456, most probably, according
to McMurtrie, from the press of Fust, now in competition with
Gutenberg. As early as 1478, a Cologne master printer issued a
Bible in two different German dialects with well over a hundred
illustrations. There were 133 editions of it during the next fifty
years. To be sure, a century was to elapse before printed Bibles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span>
were available in the home tongue throughout Germany, Britain,
Scandinavia and the Low Countries; but it was a disastrous step
to make the poorer clergy Bible-conscious.</p>

<p>Within ten years of the issue of the Indulgence mentioned
above, printing by movable type was going on in several German
cities other than Mainz and Strasbourg. German printers brought
the art to Rome in 1467, and two years later John of Spire, like
Fust a goldsmith, had started work in Venice. In Switzerland,
says McMurtrie, it seems likely that "the first printing office in
Basle began work about 1467." Printing in Paris starts about a
year later. In 1469, Caxton, a Kentishman, who had occupied
consular status to the English Merchant Adventurers at Bruges,
began translating into his own tongue for the press the <cite>Recuyell
of the Histories of Troye</cite>, printed there in 1475. A year later,
he returned to England, set up business with Colard Mansion in
the Almonry near Westminster Abbey, and from that office
produced <cite>The Dictes or Sayengis of the Philosophers</cite>. This, states
McMurtrie,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>was the first dated book printed in England, the Epilogue being
dated 1477 and in one copy November 18. Though this was the
first <em>dated</em> book, it was not certainly the first issue of the press,
Caxton's translation of Jason and a few other publications of
slight extent having probably preceded it.</p></div>

<p>Within twenty years from the start, on the threshold of the
discovery of the New World, printing from movable type is thus
in full swing throughout Europe. The speedy and consequent
intellectual ferment is an oft-told tale, scarcely worth further
comment, if it were not too customary to dwell on the alleged
impact on natural knowledge, as on biblical criticism and political
theory, of Greek scholarship imported into Europe by Byzantine
immigrants in flight from the victorious Turks. The fact is that
the positive outcome of Alexandrian mathematics, astronomy,
medicine and mechanics had long ago penetrated north-western
Europe through visits of students to the Moorish universities in
Spain, where positive knowledge had attained a higher level than
ever before through the marriage of Alexandrian science to Hindu
number-lore. Equally indisputable is the fact that the universities
of Toledo, Cordova and Seville were midwives of the cartography
which Jewish pilots put at the service of Henry the Navigator.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[Pg 20]</span>
That the new technique of printing made available for the great
explorations of the fifteenth century a new scientific amenity for
which there was a pre-existing and insistent demand is evident
from the mounting number of nautical almanacks published
between Gutenberg's first productions and the project of Columbus.
Soon there were to follow manuals of military science propounding
problems of ballistics created by the introduction of
gunpowder into warfare&mdash;like paper, from Chinese sources by
way of the Moslem world.</p>

<p>Why monks, such as Adelard of Bath, should disguise themselves
as Moslems to study in the Moorish universities during the
twelfth century is easy to understand. The Church had assumed
the responsibilities of the ancient priesthoods as custodians of the
calendar, and hence of astronomical lore, when Christianity became
the official religion of the Roman Empire. As founders of
hospitals in conformity with the beatitude of the sick visitor, they
were prohibited from active participation in the advancement of
medicine as a science by Papal bulls against dissection of the
human body, but on that account the more well-disposed to
Jewish missionaries of the Moorish culture, when the latter set
up schools of medicine on the campuses of the mediaeval universities....</p>

<p>That Ionian scientific speculations exerted a salutary influence
on Newtonian science, when the atomic concept invaded modern
European thought after the seventeenth-century translations of
Gassendi and others, is not open to dispute. Nor need we rob
the fugitive scholars of Constantinople of the credit for playing
a minor part in this climax off-stage; but the efflorescence of
science in the seventeenth century was the immediate consequence
of technological advances made in the preceding century,
and put into circulation through a commercial undertaking which
had to sell science to a reading public of master pilots, mining
engineers, artillery commanders and spectacle-makers before
naturalistic science had paid its way into university cloisters under
a more accommodating sobriquet as natural philosophy.</p>

<p>With this overdue obituary on the immigrants from the fall of
Constantinople in the year preceding the first dated product of
the new printing technique let us leave them; and again get into
focus the astonishing speed of its spread in an age when the craft
guilds jealously guarded their secrets. Here is a technical revolu<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[Pg 21]</span>tion
of the first magnitude at a time when technical innovations
diffused leisurely against menacing obstacles of custom thought
and of legal sanctions. As such, its tempo is a challenge to curiosity;
and part of the answer to the enigma is that there was already
a flourishing craft of printing to take advantage of the economy
of movable type, when Gutenberg and Fust began their partnership.</p>

<p>Again, we must pause to pay a debt of gratitude to China, and
to civilisations far older than the Chinese. We have seen that the
seal is the oldest form of signature; and that all our knowledge
of one of the earliest literatures of the world comes from clay
tablets on which the Sumerian priesthoods engraved their sign-language
with a punch to which it owes the characteristic style
called cuneiform. The same impulse to impose the signature of a
sky-sign on the clay tablet had led men to impress symbols of
ownership or good omen on the soft clay products of the potter's
wheel before the baking began. A stamp is, after all, a seal to carry
a pigment; and the practice of stamping pottery with coloured
patterns is of great antiquity. The next step is intelligible in its
own territory. In China, whence the silkworm made its lethargic
way across the great trade routes of Asia, stamping patterns on
silk was probably a practice before the Christian era began; and
it was China which produced the first paper. Probably about
<small>A.D.</small> 700, though it may well be earlier, the practice of stamping
charms by wood blocks on paper began there. In <small>A.D.</small> 767 the
Empress Shotoku of Japan ordered a million Buddhist charms to
be printed from wood blocks on paper for placing in miniature
pagodas.</p>

<p>The Chinese predilection for games such as <em>Mah Jongg</em> is an
ancient tradition; and an early use of block printing&mdash;long before
it came into Europe&mdash;is the production of <em>sheet dice</em> or, as we
should say, playing cards. As charms&mdash;pictures of saints&mdash;and as
playing cards, wood-block printing established a market in Europe
at least a century before Gutenberg's Bible. Fortunately, we
know some facts about this, as often by a happy dispensation.
For the age-long obstruction of the legal mind to progress conspires
with its obsessional drive to record its own ineptitudes and
us to perpetuate milestones of progress by the resistance it
offers to innovation. Thus we have the record of a prohibition
issued by the Provost of Paris in <small>A.D.</small> 1397 against working men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span>
playing cards on working days; and there were many such prohibitions
in German towns about this time. We have also originals
of contemporaneous wood-block prints portraying saints for sale
at shrines by travelling pedlars and palmers, encouraged to foregather
by papal indulgences for the pilgrims.</p>

<p>Like <em>Snap</em> and other children's card games of today, the first
playing cards were wholly pictorial, in suits exhibiting the feudal
hierarchy, starting with the king and queen. The joker is a relic.
Sometimes, the wood block of the picture card accommodated a
title or epithet, and often the <em>Heiligen</em>, or shrine charms promoted
by the clergy as an antidote to the carnal indulgence of card-playing,
would carry the name of the saint. Either way, the next
step was inevitable. We are now in sight of printing as a medium
for the rapid circulation of knowledge; but we have to take stock
of several features of the folk ways of Europe in the Middle Ages
before we take the next hurdle.</p>

<p>When we reach the threshold of the fifteenth century, writing
is no longer the prerogative of a priestly caste. There are merchants
with big balances in the wool trade, the herring trade and
the spice trade. There are pilots who have to rely on their <em>rutter</em>
books to navigate cargoes of the spice trade over long ocean
routes. There is a mounting volume of manorial accountancy and
litigation connected with the exchange of produce between the
countryside and the boroughs where master-craftsmen and merchants
are now aspiring to domestic conveniences heretofore inaccessible
to the landed gentry. All this signifies the pre-existence
of considerable semi-literate personnel to provide a market for
the products of Gutenberg's trade. It is necessary to say this, because
school history too often exhibits the Church and the Law
as the custodians of literacy.</p>

<p>What is true is that the monks, and to a less extent the lawyers,
were the only people who had time to write <em>at length</em> during the
century we have now reached. The lawyers we may leave to
their own sadistic pursuits.... The Church deserves kinder consideration,
even if the Church had outstayed its welcome. For
Catholicism kept alive the lucidity of picture-language in an age
when a new technique of illustration offered the only means of
grace to the few men who saw the light of science through a
miasma of verbal puns.</p>

<p>In short, we are here talking of the <em>Missals</em>, a form of sacred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span>
art with a charm to which even a hard-boiled technician such as
the writer is not entirely indifferent. There is a pathetic earnestness
about the tender care with which the monks illuminated their
copies of devotional texts, and one which established what we
may fairly call the first experiment in visual education for the
people. The monks who made the missals offered a helping hand
to the new industry. To be sure, we read a lot of rubbish written
about what we owe to them; but they did one thing of enduring
value besides starting hospitals and nursing the spectacle trade
for the benefit of "poor blind men." They made <em>block-books</em>
possible. In the admirable book already cited, this is what McMurtrie
has to say about their contribution:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is ... one exceedingly primitive block book, the <cite>Exercitium
super Pater Noster</cite>, in which the illustrations are printed
from woodcuts and the text added in manuscript.... The costume
is that of the Burgundian court of the second quarter of the
century, and this feature, in conjunction with the technique of
design and cutting led Hind to date the book about 1430 and
hardly later than 1440.</p></div>

<p>There is still argument about whether devotional block-books
with both illustrations and text produced from fixed blocks antedated
or synchronised with printing from movable type; but it
seems fairly certain that block-books were in circulation before
the wastefulness of cutting the same letter over and over again
on the same block occurred to Gutenberg, and likely enough to
many others. The issue is of academic interest only. What we can
say certainly is that the printers of playing cards and of <em>Heiligen</em>
were already involved in the book industry before it occurred
to anyone to make punches and dies for letters of the alphabet
in order to dispense with the necessity of repeatedly carving the
same sign on a composite block. Metal-founders of the thirteenth
century already knew the art of using stamps with single letters
in relief to make an impress on fine sand for molten metal when
making inscriptions, themselves to appear in relief on the finished
casting. In bell foundries, among craftsmen who made pewter
vessels with inscriptions, in the minting of coin and the casting
of medals, the use of metal single-letter punches and dies was
also commonplace.</p>

<p>In short, there is already in existence an industry of master<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
printers when the record of Gutenberg's law-suit bequeaths the
first documentary evidence of printing as we use the term today&mdash;moreover
an industry working in close contact with ancillary
crafts which had already solved the technical problems on whose
solution printing on a larger scale at less cost was attendant. There
is a market for books, with richer profits if the printer can solve
the technical problem of outsmarting the monks in the art of
making the first copy, as he can already outsmart them by reproducing
the first copy without limit. In one sense, we now have a
press.</p>

<p>Still, we have not explained the phenomenal rapidity with
which the new technique of cutting stamps to make up a frame
of continuous type spread throughout Europe, unless we look at
our period in its social entirety; and if we are to do so we must
take stock of many things which were not happening in China,
the parent civilisation of the printing art. One of them is sufficiently
obvious to be easily overlooked in an age of central heating.
Europe, as post-war American tourists will agree, is rather
cold and rather cloudy. That is why it is important to bring glass
into the picture. <small>GLASS</small> is an invention of great antiquity, being
in fact an early Egyptian amenity; but the very qualities we
admire in the iridescent glass of Etruscan or Roman vessels make
it equally unsuitable to the uses of domestic life or to the science
of gas or temperature measurement. Before you have leisure to
read, in the chilly north of the Hanseatic League or the Flemish
wool trade, you must have a technique of house design utterly
different from what meets your requirements in the sunny south
of Greece and Italy, Crete or Egypt. It is therefore relevant that
there is now, in the fifteenth century, a prosperous burgher class
with houses equipped with windows made of glass, glass of poor
quality by our standards but vastly better fitted to its principal
use than the glass of antiquity. Nor is it irrelevant that spectacles
are now coming into use for the old folk who have time on their
hands.</p>

<p>The very fact that we now have windows brings into focus that
we have an emergent class of semi-literate and relatively prosperous
merchants and craftsmen, a class which is beginning to send
its sons to grammar schools to get a smattering of reading and of
the art of cyphers. This consideration prompts reflection upon
the almost ubiquitous association of the goldsmith as the patron,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
partner or financier of the earliest master printers of books. There
is now a wealthy craft of jewellers and armourers skilled in the art
of using punches and dies to make patterns in relief on a metal
surface, with a secure trade among the nobles and the wealthier
merchants; and there are already the beginnings of a new trade in
pictorial reproduction fostered by artists seeking patrons among
them. Before printing by movable type begins, the wood-block
illustration is competing with a better technique. Instead of smearing
a sticky ink on a raised surface, it is now possible to achieve
the same end by filling the crevices in a metal plate wiped clean;
and who should be more concerned with promoting the use of
pictorial reproduction by engraving than goldsmith and jeweller
well versed in the uses of impressing a pattern in relief or intaglio?</p>

<p>What is happening in the fifteenth century is not the outcropping
of inborn genius. Contrariwise, we should regard it as the
confluence of a large number of new techniques, individually of
little import to human advancement, collectively with a new
momentum. Nor need we pride ourselves on the fact that European
civilisation proved equal to exploiting to greater advantage
what it had thanklessly received from the Eastern world. Paul
Pelliot has discovered wooden types attributed to Wang Cheng
in the beginning of the fourteenth century, well over a hundred
years before the first dated printing from movable type in Germany;
and if this invention came to nothing, have we far to seek
the explanation? With twenty-six pigeonholes for a box of letter
type at his elbow, the European compositor of the fifteenth century
enjoys an immeasurable advantage over his fourteenth-century
fellow craftsman who has to manipulate several thousand
Chinese characters. Korea took up movable type, probably
through Chinese influence, about fifty years before Europe.</p>

<p>No intelligent Anglo-American needs to be told at length how
printing contributed to the diffusion of knowledge previously
transmitted by oral tradition, how much more the master printers
and book-makers from Gutenberg to Benjamin Franklin contributed
to the making of our language habits than all the professors
of their time, how much the trade in reading matter contributed
to the great enlightenment of the four centuries which followed,
how it also contributed to the liberation of Christendom from
papal authority, what it bestowed on the age of Galileo and
Newton, how it catalysed man's thought about human dignity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span>
and fundamental human rights. What we are prone to forget is
how much water had to pass under the bridges before the homeland
of Caxton or that of Franklin could assert the ability to read
and to transcribe the written word as the birthright of every
citizen.</p>

<p>In North America and in Northwestern Europe, literacy is
today a medical diagnosis. That a person cannot read or write is
now a sufficient criterion of mental defect; and this is so in a
sense which would have been utterly false of Britain or the
United States alike when Charles Dickens wrote an uncharitable
record of his transatlantic itinerary. Until the middle of the nineteenth
century there was everywhere a large underprivileged
class cut off from the possession of books and without the incentive
to purchase reading matter....</p>

<p>By attaching a cast of the hand-set type to cylinders it was possible
to take advantage of the introduction of steam power with
considerable economy of time entailed in running off the printed
sheet; but it was impossible to reap the harvest of this economy
while it was still necessary to set type by manual extraction from
a box of each die for a letter, cypher or punctuation mark. Also,
the manufacturer of paper from rag was a relatively costly process
by modern standards; and the discovery of a cheaper source
of raw material was a precondition of expanding trade in the
printed word. Rag, be it said, is simply woven fibre of cotton or
flax; and any vegetable fibre is good enough for the work of the
wasp. It was therefore a great advance, when it was possible to
use the by-products of the lumber camps for paper manufacture.
Wood pulp as a source of paper came into its own in the eighties,
though its use goes back to a German patent about 1840. In 1857
Routledge had introduced, as an alternative source of raw material,
esparto grass from Spain and North Africa; and there had
been notable advances in the mechanics of paper production during
the preceding fifty years.</p>

<p>In 1803 the French printer Didot brought into England a
device which took advantage of steam power by running wet
pulp on to a moving, endless belt of wire mesh through which the
water drained off. It could run off in a day six miles of paper
of uniform width. In 1821 Crompton invented the process of
drying by steam-heated rollers. Between 1803 and 1815 König in
Germany and Cowper in Britain had perfected power-driven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span>
machinery for printing off a continuous roll of paper from cylinders
carrying the type cast. The four-cylinder machine patented
by Cowper and Applegarth in 1827 ran off 5,000 sheets per hour
of the London <cite>Times</cite> simultaneously printed on both sides. The
Walter Rotary of 1866 appears to have been the first cylinder
machine to print on both sides of an unwinding roll of paper
with a power-driven mechanism to cut the sheets, previously fed
to the machine by hand. By that time a cheaper source of paper
was available.</p>

<p>The advent of cheap paper accommodated the purchase of
reading matter to the purse of the poorer classes in the community;
but it did not bring into their lives a daily stimulus to
read. While type-setting remained a manual operation, the maintenance
of a daily press was beset by many difficulties and possible
only because it did not as yet aspire to the topical immediacy
which could coax a large semi-literate section of the population
into the habit of daily reading. What made possible a truly popular
press was an invention thus described by McMurtrie:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Setting extensive manuscripts by hand is, of course, a very slow
and laborious process, and as the printing industry grew in extent
and importance it was only natural that efforts should be
made to devise a means of setting type mechanically at greater
speed and less cost.... The failures were myriad. All efforts to
take the foundry type used by the compositor and set it up
mechanically came to naught. Finally, however, Ottmar Mergenthaler
invented a machine which, by the action of a keyboard
somewhat resembling that of a type-writer, assembled not type
but matrices and, when a whole line was set and spaced, cast this
line in one piece, or "slug," of type metal. This machine, which
was first put into practical use in 1886, and appropriately christened
a "linotype," gave a revolutionary impetus to the printing
industry ... as with all new inventions of importance it was
expected that thousands of compositors would be thrown out of
work. But, again as usual, the industry grew so fast that more
men were employed than before.</p></div>

<p>This device is not the only machine which sets type. On its
heels came the monotype which employs the pianola principle for
power transmission and is for some purposes preferable. The
technical advantages of one or the other are irrelevant to our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[Pg 28]</span>
theme. What makes printing by linotype an outstanding achievement
of nineteenth-century technology is that it permits type-setting
to keep pace with the tempo of topical affairs at a time
when a railroad schedule co-ordinated by telegraphy has made
man minute-conscious for the first time in history. It is at once
a new goad to the new social discipline of punctuality and a new
means of satisfying an appetite for sensation among a section of
the population not as yet attuned to habitual reading....</p>

<p>That the Moslem world of Omar Khayyam and Alkarismi
transmitted so many of the benefits of Chinese civilisation to the
West, reaping themselves no advantage from the invention of
printing, illustrates a truth which Marxist dogma ignores. Fruitful
innovation is, as the Marxist rightly asserts, the result of interplay
between human needs and natural resources; but the
triple formula of means, motive and opportunity suffices to account
for the vagaries of man's history only if we recognise the
inherent inertia of human motivation. Beliefs do not come from
heaven; but they have a remarkable tenacity in the teeth of
worldly profit, a tenacity forcefully illustrated by two facets of
the Moslem creed. In the racy, though none the less scholarly,
account of the history of printing already cited several times in
this chapter, McMurtrie states:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Koran forbade games of chance.... The Koran had been
given to the Moslems in written form, and writing, therefore,
was the only means by which it might ever be transmitted. To
this day the Koran has never been printed from type in any
Mohammedan country; it is always reproduced by lithography.</p></div>

<p>One consequence of this is that Moslem countries, and African
communities which have received their script from Moslem missionaries,
suffer from the educational disability of a cursive style
which is ill-suited to easy reading. If we are tempted to ascribe
this to defective hereditary equipment of peoples whose culture
was the inspiration of Europe in the Middle Ages, we may
well reflect with moral and intellectual benefit to ourselves on the
complacency with which western scholars disown the constructive
tasks of language-planning at a time when scientific journals
embodying new discoveries are appearing in twenty or more languages.</p>

<p>Statistics which convey a clear picture of the mounting volume<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span>
of printed matter issued annually during the four centuries of
European printing are hard to come by. The number of editions
printed in England increased from 13 in 1510 to 219 in 1580, to
about 600 a year in the first two decades of the nineteenth century
and 12,379 in 1913. Unhappily, an edition is a grossly misleading
index of production, even of new books. What we call a
modern best seller signifies a first edition of over 25,000 copies.
In the fifteenth century, the average edition was about 300 copies.
Till the middle of the eighteenth, an edition rarely exceeded 600;
but there were notable exceptions. There were 34 editions of the
<cite>Adagia</cite> of Erasmus, each of a thousand copies, in the first few
decades of the sixteenth century, and 24,000 copies of his <cite>Colloquia
Familiaria</cite> came out in the same author's lifetime. Of Luther's
tract <cite>To the Christian Nobility</cite> 4,000 copies were sold within
five days. The Bible Society, founded in 1711 by Baron von Canstein
in Halle, printed within a short space of time 340,000 copies
of the New Testament and 480,000 copies of the Scriptures as a
whole. The British and Foreign Bible Society, founded in 1804
by Thomas Charles of Bala as an incident in his crusade against
Welsh illiteracy, was responsible for the issue of 237 million
copies in the three decades 1900-1930....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So far, we have taken no cognisance of the formative role of
the master printer <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i> the culture of contemporary western
civilisation. We shall now try to get into focus the consequences
of something quite new in the history of our species, the emergence
of a social personnel with a vested interest in the enlightenment
of mankind. Of such was the inventor of the first saleable
electrical device, the originator of the very names positive and
negative in their now most common technical context, a man who
rendered signal service for his country at the court of France and
put his signature to the Declaration of Independence, the man
whose last will and testament begins "I, Benjamin Franklin,
Printer...."</p>

<p>At first, the master printer was also a publisher, till the trade
began to expand a book-seller as well, and sometimes, like Caxton,
translator or author. Nor is it surprising that printing and bookselling
still preserve the professional outlook of the mediaeval
craftsman far more than any other contemporary commercial
undertaking, with <em>mores</em> peculiar to themselves. Today, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>
throughout the past four centuries, there is still a place for the
small-scale high-quality firm in printing, publishing or bookselling
alike. Throughout the five centuries of printing from movable
type the small proprietor has ever been the ally of novel
thought; and the book trade still thrives on the free expression
of views which are anathema to big business, oil politicians and
Wall Street tycoons. To say this is not to say that every publisher,
every partner in a printing firm or every back-street book-seller is
in the vanguard of liberal sentiment and fertile cerebration; but
to be blind to their contribution to our common culture is to be
blind to one of the burning issues of our age. Even to say that the
publisher, the printer or the book-seller is always ahead of his
business colleagues in joining the bandwagon of progress is to

<p>The late printer-scholar, Theodore Low De Vinne, was
wont to exclaim with regret over a puzzling bookish
question, "Alas, bibliography is not an exact science!"
Since his day, what with the learned publications of
bibliographical societies (first and foremost&mdash;that of England),
with such scholarly independent productions as Ronald B. McKerrow's
<cite>Introduction to Bibliography</cite> and some of its followers,
and with such undertakings as the <cite>Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke</cite>&mdash;not
to speak of the many masterly library catalogues and
bibliographies which these late years have brought us&mdash;we are
almost tempted to reverse his dictum. We have all these, added
to the wealth of pioneer writings of book-lovers like Richard
de Bury, Gabriel Naude, Guillaume François De Bure, Gabriel
Peignot, Thomas Frognall Dibdin, and the more scientific but no
more (nor less) book-loving Panzer, Hain, Brunet, Renouard, Bradshaw,
Haebler, Proctor, Claudin, and our own Wilberforce Eames.
We pause for breath, but have only picked a few random names
from the long roll of those who have loved and worked for the arts
that go into the making, and the science that goes into the understanding
of a printed book&mdash;the vehicle which must continue to
preserve and to carry down through the ages the results of men's
thoughts and the records of their deeds.</p>

<p>All this is as it should be, but of late, and especially in connection
with the present vogue for collecting the works of living
authors, a certain quality (shall we call it self-consciousness) has
crept in, an undue stressing of small technicalities, and we blush to
confess a confused feeling of sympathy for the modern book-hunter,
who is having so much of his fun taken away from him by neat little
textbooks and articles, bristling with allusions to "points," "right
copies," "firsts" and the like (with the inevitable quotation marks)
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span>and filled with weighty questions of dollars and pounds&mdash;the seemingly
all-important matter of the investment value of our treasures.
This surely is not the fine frenzy which possessed Charles Lamb
when he wrote: "Do you remember the brown suit which you made
to hang upon you, till all your friends cried 'Shame upon you!' It
grew so threadbare&mdash;and all because of that folio 'Beaumont and
Fletcher,' which you dragged home late at night from Barker's
in Covent Garden. Do you remember how we eyed it for weeks
before we could make up our minds to the purchase, and had not
come to a determination till it was near ten o'clock of the Saturday
night, when you set off from Islington, fearing you should be too
late. And when the old book-seller with some grumbling opened
his shop, and by the twinkling taper (for he was setting bedwards),
lighted out the relic from his dusty treasures, and when you lugged
it home, wishing it were twice as cumbersome, and when you presented
it to me, and when we were exploring the perfectness of it
(<em>collating</em> you called it), and while I was repairing some of the
loose leaves with paste, which your impatience would not suffer
to be left till daybreak&mdash;was there no pleasure in being a poor
man!"</p>

<p>Where there is much smoke, however, there is fire, and it is
assuredly good that this interest in bibliographical things should
have swept the country, and incidentally that the joys of the bibliomaniac
and the bibliophile are being experienced today by many
more than the elect few of the past, on whom we love to dwell.
But if we moderns are doomed to buy our first editions ready labelled
and to have our equations worked out in advance, if a fine
copy must be termed immaculate and the back of a book must be
its spine, etc., etc., ad infinitum, let us start with the right premises,
and hold on to the terms which were proverbial before we were
born. Which brings us to our point&mdash;What is a Colophon?</p>

<p>The question would seem a reflection upon the intelligence of
the average book-lover, at this late day, were it not that there seems
to be a growing tendency, shared (even instigated) by lexicographers,
to mis-define the word, or to use it out of its truly bibliographical
and philological meaning. To book-lovers and collectors
of even the preceding generation, acquainted as they were with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span>
the niceties of their vocation, or avocation, the suggestion of more
than one signification would have seemed well-nigh an insult.
Perhaps it is even because we are living in this late day that heresies
have crept in. After all, it is nearly a quarter of a century since
the Caxton Club of Chicago brought out <cite>An Essay on Colophons</cite>,
by Dr. Alfred W. Pollard, later Keeper of Printed Books at the
British Museum, whose word on all bibliographical matters carries
the highest authority&mdash;the Club thereby performing one of those
great services to students of bibliography for which it and similar
institutions are acclaimed by an appreciative, if limited, circle. Perhaps
the very limits of the circle are accountable for lack of knowledge,
and it may be that a book, printed nearly twenty-five years
ago in an edition of some two hundred and fifty copies, may never
have come within the ken of a writer on bookish things today&mdash;even
of an earnest one. But that is just where our quarrel begins&mdash;ought
anyone to write on colophons, or on anything else, without
some knowledge of at least the chief literature of the subject, and
should the next man, and the next, be allowed to hand on an error,
or perhaps a misconception, without a thought of the original
sources of information? For that is just what has been happening
in America in this matter, and what it seems must also be occurring
in greater ones. There is plenty of thorough scholarship here,
scholarship that shrinks from no drudgery&mdash;then why is it that
so much hasty, slipshod work is allowed to pass?</p>

<p>But we were speaking of colophons&mdash;a word which, to many
people who trouble with it at all, seems to mean almost anything,&mdash;for
instance the mark or device of a printer or publishing firm,
placed anywhere at random in a book, possibly bearing a motto or
a name. Indeed, this is the signification which has frequently been
given to it of late in print and in common speech by people who
should have known better, and whom a little thought or a little
more research would have taught better. For instance, a publisher's
assistant suggested that a given place upon the title page is the
proper location for the colophon; a librarian wrote to request a
copy of the "colophon of the Grolier Club" to add to a collection;
a book-trade magazine issued an article on devices or trade-marks
of publishers of today, appearing on the title pages of their publi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>cations,
and dubbed them all colophons; a college professor used
the term in like manner; and all this occurred within a period of a
few months.</p>

<p>The only protest to be raised in print seems to be that of Leonard
L. Mackall, in his dependable "Notes for Bibliophiles," a department
of the <cite>Herald Tribune's</cite> Sunday magazine, <cite>Books</cite>. In the issue
of March 17, 1929, he wrote: "Right here we must call special
attention to the fact that, some modern ignorant or careless misuse
to the contrary, notwithstanding, a colophon is not really a colophon
at all unless it appears at the end of the book. Most certainly
the word does not properly mean merely a publisher's device wherever
used, as stated in a [recent] anonymous illustrated article."</p>

<p>No one has heeded him, however, and my own like-minded objections
were met with the advice to look in the dictionary, and
then the blow fell! It is true that some dictionaries, but by no
means all, countenance this usage of colophon as a device upon
a title page. Before quoting their definitions, let us look at the
Oxford English Dictionary, where we find:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. "Finishing stroke"; "crowning touch," <cite>obs.</cite></p>

<p>2. The inscription or device, sometimes pictorial or emblematic,
formerly placed at the end of a book or manuscript, and containing
the title, the scribe's or printer's name, date and place of printing,
etc. Hence, <em>from title page to colophon</em>.</p></div>

<p>It may be noted that, of the various examples (1774-1874)
quoted by the Oxford English Dictionary, not one refers to the
colophon as placed elsewhere than at the end of the book.</p>

<p>Our Century Dictionary is sound on the subject, but we have in
Funk &amp; Wagnalls' Standard Dictionary:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. An inscription or other device formerly placed at the end of
books and writings, often showing the title, writer's or printer's
name and date and place of printing.</p>

<p>2. An emblematic device adopted by a publisher and impressed
on his books, usually on the title page of each volume (accompanied
by an illustration of the printer's mark of Nicolas Jenson,
inscribed: "Colophon of Nicolas Jenson" [1481]).</p></div>

<p>The phrase "usually on the title page" (not in the Oxford Eng<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span>lish
Dictionary) seems to us absolutely wrong, and not to be countenanced
for a moment by bookmen who have proper regard for
the correct usage of words.</p>

<p>The corresponding definition in late editions of Webster's Dictionary
is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An emblem, usually a device assumed by the publishing-house,
placed either on the title page, or at the end of a book.</p></div>

<p>In what subtle way this secondary and inadequate definition has
crept into American usage we do not know, and we plead earnestly
for its abandonment.</p>

<p>In the encyclopedias consulted, there is nothing disturbing, the
definition of the <cite>Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite>, written by Dr. Pollard,
being especially clear and concise. It runs in part as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... a final paragraph in some manuscripts and many early
printed books, giving particulars as to authorship, date and place
of production, and sometimes expressing the thankfulness of the
author, scribe or printer on the completion of his task ... the
importance of these final paragraphs slowly diminished, and the
information they gave was gradually transferred to the title page.
Complete title pages bearing the date and name of the publishers
are found in most books printed after 1520, and the final paragraph,
if retained at all, was gradually reduced to information as
to the printer and date. From the use of the word in the sense of
a "finishing stroke" (from the story that the final charge of the
cavalry of Colophon was always decisive) such a final paragraph
as has been described is called by bibliographers a "colophon,"
but this name for it is quite possibly not earlier than the eighteenth
century.</p></div>

<p>Let us turn from general works to those specifically bibliographical.
In his <cite>Introduction to Bibliography</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Dr. McKerrow writes:
"In the early days of printing, the end of the book was the normal
place for the printer's name and the place and date of printing to
appear. The history of the colophon is merely that of the gradual
transference of this information to the title page. When this was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span>complete the colophon was as a rule of no use and it was abandoned."</p>

<p>Later, among his cataloguing instructions we find: "A colophon
should always be noticed, if there is one. It is also, I think, desirable
to record the occurrence of a printer's device (even without a verbal
imprint) at the end of a book, as this often appears to take the
place of a colophon."</p>

<p>Iolo Williams' <cite>Elements of Book-Collecting</cite><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> contains this paragraph:
"In the earliest printed books the title page's functions were
performed by the colophon, a word which is a transliteration of the
Greek, a summit or finishing stroke. The colophon is put, not near
the beginning of the book, like the title page, but at the end, and it
usually takes the form of a statement that here ends such-and-such
a book, written by so-and-so, printed by so-and-so at such-and-such
a place and date. The use of the colophon has been revived in certain
finely-printed modern books, but such modern volumes usually contain
both a title page and a colophon."</p>

<p>Though not quite as satisfying, the following allusion in Van
Hoesen and Walter's <cite>Bibliography</cite><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> should be quoted, as occurring
in a modern American treatise on the subject: "The early printers
used the colophon at the end of the book instead of a title page, and
the colophon is still used to indicate the printing firm in cases where
it is not part of the publishing firm given on the title page."</p>

<p>These are the latest printed words that we have noticed. Suffice
it to say that we have nowhere found in earlier important manuals
anything but the (to us) proper explanation of the term. In other
words, we gather from important sources that, while a colophon
may include or even take the form of a printer's mark or device,
such a mark, placed upon a title page, is not a colophon.</p>


<p>Aroused by the dictionary findings, and discovering those American
students of bibliography whom I consulted to be in agreement
with me, I wrote to Dr. Pollard, as to a court of final appeal,
to inquire if he considered it meticulous to object to the intrusion of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span>this illogical trade definition which some dictionaries and many
people are giving us. His answer, which I am allowed to quote,
seems definite and wise enough to carry conviction, coming as it
does from the admitted authority on the subject: "If a sufficient
number of people misuse a word, Dictionaries have to record the
wrong use as well as the right, as in the case of <em>hectic</em> and crowds of
other words. But the misuse of the word <em>colophon</em> as a synonym
for the printer's mark or device, without regard to position, has not
yet gone as far as this and should be strenuously resisted. By standard
use as well as by etymology, the word means the crowning
stroke, or finishing touch, to a book or part of a book, and it must
come at the end of the book, or part of a book, rightly to be given
this title.</p>

<p>"In cataloguing early books it would not in my judgment be
incorrect to enter the printer's device at the end of a book, under
the heading colophon."</p>

<p>And now, the unpleasantly controversial side of the matter having
been disposed of (if so large an adjective as controversial may
be applied to so small a paper), let us devote our little remaining
space to the colophons themselves, first turning our attention to Dr.
Pollard's book,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> with his own rendering into English of the unwieldy
fifteenth-century Latin.</p>

<p>In the introduction, Dr. Richard Garnett gives a brief sketch of
the derivation and earliest uses of the term. He quotes the Greek
word <em>colophon</em>, the head or summit of anything, usually used in a
figurative sense, the position on a crest of the City of Colophon
(whence its name), the first appearance of the word in the seventeenth
century, with its secondary classical sense of a "finishing
stroke" or a "crowning touch," and goes on to say: "Of the use of
the word <em>colophon</em> in the particular significance elucidated in this
essay&mdash;the end or ultimate paragraph of a book or manuscript&mdash;the
earliest example quoted in the New English Dictionary is from
Warton's <cite>History of English Poetry</cite> published in 1774. A quarter
of a century before this it is found as a term needing no explanation
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span>in the first edition of the <cite>Typographical Antiquities</cite> of Joseph Ames,
published in 1749. How much older it is than this cannot lightly
be determined. The bibliographical use appears to be unknown
to the Greek and Latin lexicographers, medieval as well as classical.
Pending further investigation, it seems not unlikely that it may
have been developed out of the secondary classical sense already
mentioned sometime during the seventeenth century, when the interest
in bibliography which was then beginning to be felt would
naturally call into existence new terms of art."</p>


<p>While acknowledging the great interest that many authors have
found in individual colophons, Dr. Pollard states that his task is
the more ambitious, if less entertaining one of making a special
study of this feature in fifteenth century books with the object of
ascertaining what light it throws on the history of printing, and on
the habits of the early printers and publishers. His first conclusion
being that colophons are the sign and evidence of the printer's
pride in his work, he draws attention to the utter lack of such information
as they give in the very earliest books of all, as contrasted
with the self-glorification of Fust and Schöffer when, printing
independently, they affixed the first known printed colophon
to their Psalter of 1457 (in at least one copy accompanied by their
device):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The present copy of the Psalms, adorned with beauty of capital
letters, and sufficiently marked out with rubrics, has been thus
fashioned by an ingenious invention of printing, and stamping
without any driving of the pen. And to the worship of God has
been diligently brought to completion by Johann Fust, a citizen of
Mainz, and Peter Schöffer of Gernsheim, in the year of the Lord
1457, on the vigil of the Feast of the Assumption.</p></div>

<p>Of Peter Schöffer's later allusion to the shields of his device Dr.
Pollard writes: "Needless discussions have been raised as to what
was the use and import of printers' devices, and it has even been
attempted to connect them with literary copyright, with which they
had nothing whatever to do, literary copyright in this decade depending
solely on the precarious courtesy of rival firms, or possibly
on the rules of their trade-guilds. But here, on the authority of the
printer who first used one, we have a clear indication of the reason
which made him put his mark on a book&mdash;the simple reason that
he was proud of his craftsmanship and wished it to be recognized
as his. 'By signing it with his shields Peter Schöffer has brought
the book to a happy completion.'"</p>

<p>Again he calls attention to the boast of John of Speier at Venice,
"primus in Adriaca formis impressit aenis," by which he asserts
his individual priority over any other firm in that city. And here is
the rhyming colophon used by the same John, in which he boasts
with some ambiguity of the number of copies of Cicero which he
has printed in his two editions:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">From Italy once each German brought a book.<br />
A German now will give more than they took.<br />
For John, a man whom few in skill surpass,<br />
Has shown that books may best be writ with brass.<br />
Speier befriends Venice; twice in four months has he<br />
Printed this Cicero, in hundreds three.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><br />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In wording their colophons, the early printers were only following
the constant practice of medieval scribes, of whose many colophons
a selection of examples is given in Bradley's <cite>Dictionary of
Miniaturists</cite>.</p>

<p>The moving of printers from one town to another, transference
of their stocks, their quarrels, their boastings and pleas for favor
with those in high places, all are followed, and much information
gathered in the <cite>Essay</cite>. There is simple pathos in the colophon of
the <cite>Chronicles of the londe of England</cite> printed at Antwerp in 1493,
which records the death of its famous printer, Gerard Leeu,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>a man of grete wysedom in all manner of kunnyng; whych nowe
is come from lyfe unto the deth, which is grete harme for many
of poure man. On whos sowle God almyghty for hys hygh grace
haue mercy. Amen.</p></div>

<p>"A man whose death is great harm for many a poor man must
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span>needs have been a good master, and a king need want no finer epitaph,"
writes Dr. Pollard.</p>


<p>The days when we find the book trade highly organized and the
functions of printers and publishers clearly separated, are pictured
in the following colophon:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Here you have, most honest reader, six works, etc. It remains,
therefore, for you to make grateful acknowledgement to those who
have produced them: in the first place to that eminent man Master
Simon Radin, who saw to their being brought to light from the
obscurity in which they were buried; next to F. Cyprian Beneti for
his editorial care; then to Jean Petit, best of book-sellers, who
caused them to be printed at his expense; nor less than these to
Andrieu Bocard, the skilful chalcographer, who printed them so
elegantly and with scrupulous correctness, June 28, 1500. Praise
and glory to God.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></div>

<p>Here are men making aspersions on the editions of rival publishers,
with warnings against them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Here end the Decretals, most correctly printed in the bounteous
city of Rome, queen of the whole world, by those excellent men
Master Ulrich Han, a German, and Simon di Niccolo of Lucca:
with the ordinary glosses of Bernard of Parma and his additions,
which are found in few copies; both printed and corrected with
the greatest diligence. Purchase these, book-buyer, with a light
heart, for you will find such excellence in this volume that you
will be right in easily reckoning other editions as worth no more
than a straw.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></div>

<p>We find that the Nuremberg Chronicle is the only book which
Dr. Pollard can call to mind that gives explicit information as to its
illustrators, Michael Wolgemut and Wilhelm Pleydenworff; and
finally we come to books where the author takes a hand, and we
sometimes have a double colophon, as in the case of the <cite>Morte
d'Arthur</cite>. Here we have Sir Thomas Malory's colophon, requesting
the reader's prayer for his deliverance, and for the repose of his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[Pg 42]</span>soul, and William Caxton's business-like statement as editor,
printer and publisher.</p>


<p>The author's struggle with the printer, to obtain his own way, is
no new thing, as proved by this late colophon of the musician,
Johann von Cleve, affixed to his <em>Cantiones</em>, 1580:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As I come to the end of my task it seems worth while to inform
students and amateurs of music that this collection of Motets was
in the first place entrusted to Philip Ulhard, citizen and printer of
Augsburg, to be printed, and that he (as often happens), being
made unreasonably capricious by bodily ill-health, often did not
carry out our intention, and compelled me, by leaving out some
motets (which however, if life bears me company and God helps,
will shortly be published), to abridge the work, and more especially
as the same printer, when the work was not yet finished,
came to an end of his days, and there upon the work was entrusted
to Andreas Reinheckel to be completed, if anything, therefore, is
found which might disturb a connoisseur, I pray musicians to bear
with it with equanimity. Farewell. In the year of the Lord 1580,
in the month of January.</p></div>

<p>We have noted one rhyming colophon, a mannerism much
affected by Italian printers. Another fanciful custom by which the
early printers called attention to their colophons was the use of
eccentric arrangements of types, by which these final paragraphs
appeared in the shape of wedges, funnels, diamonds, drinking
glasses and the like.</p>

<p>The earliest known title page is in a Bull of Pius IX, printed in
Mainz by Fust and Schöffer in 1463, but it was some twenty years
before the custom became common. At first the title only, taking
the form of a single sentence, appeared at the top of a title page,
but it was not long before, either in the interests of decoration or of
advertising, a simple woodcut or the device of the printer appeared
below the title. In his <cite>A Treatise on Title-pages</cite>, 1902, Mr. De
Vinne proposes the following ingenious explanation of the evolution
of the printer's mark: "It was hoped that the distinctiveness
of a peculiar device would be remembered by the book-buyer who
had forgotten the name of his preferred printer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>"In the beginning the device was put at the end of the book,
above or below the colophon. It was at first a small and simple
design ... but the eagerness to have a device that should be striking
led to its enlargement and afterward to an entire change of
position. When the greater part of the last page was preoccupied
by the last paragraph of the text, the device required a separate
page. This led to making full-page devices and afterward to the
putting of the device on the first page."</p>

<p>As time went on it was only natural that the remaining space at
the foot of the title pages should be utilized for brief details of
printing and publishing, but the transition was gradual and unsystematic.
Indeed, some printers continued to use colophons alone
well into the sixteenth century, and there are frequent instances
during that century of books containing both title pages and colophons,
the latter being a repetition, at the end of the book, of the
imprint, as the few business-like lines at the foot of the title page
had come to be named.</p>

<p>By the time that title pages were firmly established, publishing
had become a separate business, and the publisher was not long in
assuming the ascendency, often pushing the printer altogether into
the background and appearing alone in the imprint. For a long time
the printer modestly tucked in his name wherever he could, sometimes
on the verso of the title page, and sometimes at the bottom
of the last page, but in a formal manner, without the naive and
often delightful and useful details which make the early colophons
so interesting.</p>

<p>With the nineteenth-century revival of interest in typography,
the printer came to the fore again and we see his name appearing
in a new place, the certificate, preceding the title page&mdash;an entire
leaf, moreover, on which are set forth the details in which he is
interested, the paper, number of copies, and so on. This use seems
to have been introduced by the finely printed volumes of the French
book clubs, with their "Justification du tirage," and it was followed
through the later decades of the nineteenth century, in the publications
of book clubs and many other privately and finely printed
volumes. Simultaneously with these came the publications of the
Kelmscott and other private presses, which revived the use of colophons
in the early manner. The separate page, placed at the end
of the finely printed book of today, giving details of the making of

<p>This is but the very logical expression in the books themselves
of the modern trend, so assiduously cultivated, toward the making
of good books, and the return to prominence of the printer after
the long period of his subservience to the publisher. In the present-day

<cite><small>Printers' Marks</small></cite></h2>

<p class="center p22 small1">From <cite>Fifty Printers' Marks</cite> by Edwin E. Willoughby. Copyright 1947 by

California Press.</p>

<p>A printer's mark is a trade-mark. Printers used them in the
fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries for the same purpose
that printers employ them today&mdash;to ornament their books
and to make each volume readily recognizable as the product of
the printing establishment which produced it.</p>

<p>The printer's mark was but one of the many types of marks
which, largely because of the widespread illiteracy of the people,
were used throughout all phases of medieval life. The ownership
of objects, for example, was often shown by means of a regularly
used mark. Two examples of this type of mark, the seal and the
cattle brand, go back to the dawn of history and have continued
in use to the present time. Merchants in the Middle Ages often
identified their property by placing on it their merchants' marks.</p>

<p>The mark of a merchant was legally recognized as his by his
guild or by the town government. Often it was a representation
of the tools of the man's trade or a replica of his house sign.
Sometimes it was an animal or object which formed a pun on the
merchant's name. Frequently, simple geometric designs were
used. Toward the latter part of the Middle Ages, as merchants
grew richer and more powerful, they aped the upper class by
making their marks resemble, as closely as they dared, the heraldic
devices of the knights and nobles. These marks enabled employees
or hired porters to recognize at a glance a merchant's
property.</p>

<p>Places, as well as objects, were identified by means of marks.
Inns, shops and similar public places in those days before houses
were numbered were designated by house signs. The Tabard, the
inn from which Chaucer's pilgrims started for Canterbury under
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[Pg 46]</span>the leadership of its host, Harry Baillie, took its name from its
sign&mdash;a representation of a short outer jacket. An equally famous
tavern, patronized by Shakespeare, Ben Jonson and other "sirenical
gentlemen," bore the "Sign of the Mermaid." And over the
door of the Globe, Shakespeare's theater, hung a picture of Atlas
bearing the world on his shoulders.</p>

<p>Printing houses, like other business establishments, were
known by house signs. The printer's mark of Adrien van Berghen
supplies an illustration. <a href="#i048">[Page 48.]</a></p>

<p>Not only were objects and places designated by marks in the
Middle Ages, but under certain conditions people were recognized
by them also. A knight, his face obscured by his helmet,
made his identity known by wearing on his helmet, shield and
tabard simple pictures or symbols by which he could be recognized.
As it was usual for members of the same family to wear the
same emblems, these simple pictures, many of which became
conventionalized, descended from father to son, indicated relationships,
and finally developed under the control of officers of
the king into the elaborate system of heraldry.</p>

<p>Marks, then, were widely used in the Middle Ages. It was inevitable
that they should be used to identify the makers of manufactured
goods. Craftsmen with pride in their work naturally
desired others to recognize their products. As a result, the use
of trade-marks became common. Craftsmen of every trade were
frequently compelled either by law or by guild regulations, to
affix a mark to their products as a guarantee of their honesty and
good workmanship. Such marks were required especially of goldsmiths,
silversmiths and other artisans who were under unusual
temptation to misrepresent the quality of their goods. In England,
to take another example, arrowheads, the quality of which
might determine the issue of a battle, were ordered, by a statute
of Henry IV, to be "marked with the mark of him who made the
same."</p>

<p>These trade-marks performed much the same function as the
house mark or the merchant's mark; indeed, the three were often
the same. They enabled a purchaser, literate or illiterate, to identify
the maker of a product and to buy thereafter according as he
had been satisfied or displeased with the first article purchased.</p>

<p class="pc1 small1">JACQUES MAILLET began publishing at Lyons in 1482, and probably began printing at the
same time. His mark represents a shield, supported by two dogs, which
bears his initials and a mallet (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maillet</i> in French), hanging from a tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span></p>


<p>The printer, to be sure, was under few of the compulsions to
use a trade-mark that beset his fellow craftsmen. His patrons
were literate; they could read his name and address&mdash;when he
chose to set them down&mdash;either in the colophon at the end of the
book or on the title page. But the example of other craftsmen was
not to be resisted. Besides, a well-made printer's mark, or a publisher's
device, could be both useful and ornamental. Put at the
end of the book, it could give it a fitting close. Used in the middle
of a book, it could set off chapters and parts. Above all, especially
when it was printed in red, it could give life and balance to a title
page.</p>

<p class="pc1 small1 center">ADRIEN VAN BERGHEN in his mark pictures his printing house "at the Sign of the Great Golden
Mortar in the market place" at Antwerp, where he started in 1500.</p>

<p>By the printer's mark, also, a prospective purchaser could recognize
at a glance the product of a press. It could prevent a careful
purchaser from being deceived by a false imprint. "Look at
my sign," warns Benedictus Hector of Bologna, "which is represented
on the title page and you can never be mistaken." It was
harder to counterfeit a printer's mark than to filch his name.</p>

<p>Even a mark, however, was not infallible protection. The
"prince of printers," Aldus Manutius, complains that his Florentine
competitors "have affixed our well known sign of the dolphin
wound around an anchor. But," he adds, "they have so man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[Pg 49]</span>aged
that any person who is in the least acquainted with the books
of our production cannot fail to observe that this is an impudent
fraud; for the head of the dolphin is turned to the left, whereas
that of ours is well known to be turned toward the right."</p>

<p class="pc1 small1">WILLIAM CAXTON, the first English printer, printed his own translation of a French romance,
<cite>Recuyell of the Histories of Troy</cite>, in 1474. At his press at
Westminster he completed nearly eighty books between 1477 and 1491,
many of which he also translated from the French.</p>

<p>In one country only, and there for but a brief period, was the
use of a mark made compulsory. In 1539, François I, in an act
intended to suppress both the piracy of copyrighted works and
the printing of heretical books, ordered every printer and book-seller
in France to have his own device so that purchasers might
easily ascertain where books were printed and sold.</p>

<p>Although (with this exception) the use of marks was voluntary
with printers, they were early adopted. In 1457 Fust and
Schöffer, the successors of Gutenberg, first employed one in the
Mainz Psalter, the first book to contain the name of the printer
and the place and date of printing. [Page 39.] The device con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[Pg 50]</span>sisted
of two shields resembling coats of arms. Other printers
quickly followed their example. As the fifteenth century saw the
rise of the mercantile class, it is not surprising that printers used
in their marks heraldic devices, if they had the right to bear arms,
or shields displaying their merchant's marks in a manner often
resembling armorial bearings.</p>

<p>Frequently, printers used as the central part of their marks the
signs which served to designate their places of business. Pierre
LeRouge, for example, used a red rosebush for his sign and in
his device. The London printer, Berthelet, used in like manner
the figure of Lucrece.</p>

</div>

<p class="pc1 smal11">WILLIAM FAQUES began printing in London about 1503. His mark represents a hexagram
of interlocking triangles bearing biblical quotations, which enclose his
monogram pierced by an arrow. The initials "GF" are those of the
French form of his name.</p>


<p>If the printer's name could be punned on, it was common to
use for a mark an object the name of which sounded like the
printer's own. Jacques Maillet's surname means mallet. He made
it easy to remember by displaying a mallet in his device. [Page
47.] A few printers, among them Aldus Manutius, John Day,
John Wight and Willem Vorsterman, even used their own
portraits in their marks.</p>

<p>Many other signs and emblems were employed. In an age fond
of symbolism it is not surprising to find that many marks had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[Pg 51]</span>
symbolic and mystical meanings&mdash;not only in the earlier period,
when ecclesiastical symbols were often used, but in the later
period also, when devices were frequently copied from emblem
books. Sometimes a printer would use a woodcut to illustrate a
book and then, because it struck his fancy, adopt it as his mark.
Thomas Gardiner and Thomas Dawson, partners, on the other
hand, had a block which contained, around a central open square,
figures forming a rebus of their names: a gardener, a daw and the
sun. With their initials in the open square, it served as a mark;
with the appropriate display letter, it was a factotum bearing the
initial letter of the first word of a chapter.</p>

<p>Printers' marks, in fact, took a multitude of forms during the
fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In the late seventeenth,
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, they became
conventionalized and were used infrequently; but they did not
die out altogether. The Oxford and Cambridge University
presses, for example, continued to put them on the title pages of
their books.</p>

<p>The revival of printing late in the nineteenth century saw an
increased use of the printer's mark. This was almost inevitable,
for when the craftsmen strove to do fine printing, they desired,
just as did the craftsmen of the fifteenth century, to have their
work easily recognized. Today, private presses which specialize
in fine printing, some university presses, and many publishing
firms, frequently use marks which both ornament their title pages
and identify for the reader the creator of the volume.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that the title page was evolved at a comparatively
late date in the history of the book, and is indeed almost
unknown before the printed book. There are a few examples
among early surviving manuscripts of a separate leaf being used
for the title, but they are quite exceptional, and even these give
the title on the back of this leaf. The usual practice of the calligrapher
was to give any information considered desirable as to
the author and the date and place of the making of the manuscript
in the colophon. This practice was taken over by the
printers, although in the first years of the new art they frequently
said nothing as to place of printing, probably with the
deliberate intention of concealing the fact that the book was produced
by mechanical means. The title page as we know it, giving
the title, author's name and an imprint, being, in fact, a kind of
advertisement of the book, was not well established until some
years after 1500....</p>

<p>The title page owes its origin, according to one theory, to the
fact that printers found it necessary to protect the first leaf of
the text. Whereas a manuscript would be bound as soon as the
calligrapher had finished the text, most of the copies of a printed
edition were delivered to a book-seller in sheets, and many might
remain unbound for years. Hence arose the practice of beginning
the book on the second leaf or on the back of the first leaf. The
first page could then be used for the purpose of advertising the
book, for the fully-developed title page arose out of a commercial
need. A few early examples of the addition of a brief title on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[Pg 53]</span>the first page are known, the first being that of a Bull of Pope Pius
II, printed by Fust and Schöffer at Mainz in 1463. But the blank
title leaf is found for many years after that date, and to the end
of the fifteenth century a title leaf containing a brief description
in a few words is common. As late as 1548 we find the brothers
Dorici at Rome printing several volumes of the works of Cardinal
Bembo with the title on the back of the first leaf. An edition of
the Vulgate printed at Venice in 1487 by Georgius Arrivabene
offers an example of the most rudimentary form of a title page,
with the single word <em>Biblia</em> on the first leaf.</p>

<p>The example of Ratdolt at Venice, who in 1476 printed a Calendar
of Regiomontanus with woodcut borders and an imprint
on the first leaf, was not followed by contemporary printers. Even
this solitary case hardly presents a title page in the form in which
we know it, since the leaf, in place of a title, has a poem in praise
of the book. Of the fully developed title page, giving title, author
and full imprint, Dr. Haebler, the German authority on incunabula,
knows of only one instance in the fifteenth century, a book
by Johannes Glogoviensis printed by Wolfgang Stöckel at Leipzig
in 1500; the title itself, however, is cut on wood.</p>

<p>The lettering of the simple fifteenth-century title page was
often that of the text of the book, or sometimes a larger, heading
type was used. Very frequently the words were cut on wood, and
since for the printer it was as easy to print from a block containing
a design in addition to a brief title, the woodcut illustration
on the first leaf soon followed. The examples of the John
Lydgate, printed by Pynson, <em>c.</em> 1515, and of the <cite>Deceyte of
Women</cite>, printed by Abraham Vele about 1550, are typical title
pages of popular books of the earlier printers. In Spain especially
this combination of title and illustration, in that country often an
heraldic cut, both cut on wood, became the fashion and persisted
for many years in the next century. Scenes from school life
often illustrated educational texts, while a school of woodcutters
at Florence designed a famous series of illustrations which decorated
the title pages of devotional tracts by Savonarola and other
works. The first printers' devices, the two shields of Fust and
Schöffer and the double cross rising out of a circle at Venice,
were added to the colophons, and it was only when the French
printers began to use large devices surrounded by borders, for
which there was no room on the last leaf, that the printer's name,
or at least mark, began to appear on the title page. Thus one further
step was taken towards the title page as we know it.</p>

<p>The sixteenth century is especially the age of the woodcut
title-border (or metal-cut, for the material used for blocks was
frequently metal). The practice of decorating the first leaf of the
text with a woodcut border had been started by Ratdolt at
Venice, and after 1490 was common among the printers of that
city. In fact, several of the borders originally used for an opening
were actually converted into title-borders after 1500. During
the following century the variety of borders used in all the countries
where printing was practised is remarkable. In Germany
especially, during the years of the Reformation, when the printing
press was unusually active, a very large number of decorative
borders were cut, many of them by artists of the first rank, including
even Dürer and Holbein. The work of the Holbeins and
Urs Graf at Basle is well known to English book collectors. Perhaps
less familiar is the work of Hans Baldung Grien, Hans Weiditz
and Daniel Hopfer at Strasbourg and Augsburg, and that
extraordinary series of designs which appear on the Luther tracts
printed at Wittenberg and on similar works produced in Saxony.
Many of these borders are highly successful as decorative pieces.
The fact that they are less familiar to us may be accounted for
by two circumstances. In the first place the earlier book collectors
were almost all collectors of the classics, and the first writers
on the history of printing, except in the matter of the invention
of printing, approached the subject from the point of view of the
student of the Greek and Roman classical writers. In the second
place the German printers cut themselves off from Western Europe
by clinging to the gothic letter after Italy, France and
finally England had adopted Roman and Italic, even for books in
the vernacular....</p>

<p>There is one point about the early woodcut borders which
must seem strange to the printer of today, and that is the suitability
of the decoration to the subject matter of the book. The
sixteenth-century printer naturally found it economical to ignore
the fact that a border originally intended for a Bible was not
suitable for a medical work. He did not regard it as incongruous
to use a border depicting scenes from Greek mythology on a
French medieval romance. Even a printer of the class of Jean de
Tournes uses the same piece on the title page of a <cite>Xenophon</cite> and
of a book of French verse. Nor was the average printer very particular
about the state of a block. Especially in England, where
the general standard was lower than on the Continent, a damaged
block would be used as long as it held together.</p>

are generally decorated with leaf forms like the "petits fers" of this title.

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[Pg 57]</span></p>
</div>

<p>In the second half of the century two rival fashions of decoration
were developed which finally banished the woodcut border,
first the method of decoration by type ornaments or printers'
flowers, and secondly the engraved title page. There is one example
of type ornament known even in the fifteenth century, in
an <cite>Aesop</cite> printed at Parma in 1483. After 1500, examples of borders
made up of separate cast pieces are fairly frequent and are
especially common in England in the books of Wynkyn de
Worde and his contemporaries. But it is not until about 1560 that
we find borders built up of type ornaments worked into arabesque
patterns. It seems to have been Robert Granjon, the engraver
of types at Paris and Lyons, who cut arabesque fleurons,
divided them up and built up fresh patterns out of their component
parts. The use of printers' flowers in borders is found at
most centers of printing towards the end of the century and obtained
its greatest popularity in the Netherlands and in England.
Many fine examples are found in English books from about 1570
for the next fifty years. Joseph Moxon, who wrote on English
letter-founding in 1683, tells us that they were considered old-fashioned
in his day. They were revived again in the eighteenth
century by P. S. Fournier at Paris, who cut many new designs
which were copied all over Europe. Fournier's flowers could
be built up to form all manner of ornaments and were more adaptable
than the arabesques of the sixteenth century, when the original
unit always resulted in the same pattern. Just as Granjon had
devised a method of decorating without the use of the woodcut
block, so Fournier designed his new flowers in order that printers
might dispense with engraved vignettes. However, the vogue
of the Fournier designs had a shorter life, and may be said to have
been killed by the classical school of printing of the end of the
century.</p>

<p>Engraving on copper was practised in the fifteenth century,
but the engraved title page originates about 1550. Curiously
enough, the earliest known engraved border occurs in an English
book, the Anatomy of Thomas Geminus, printed in London
in 1545. In the following year we find a second example, cut by</p>

<p>Corneille de La Haye for Balthazar Arnoullet at Lyons, where there
was a remarkable group of engravers at work about this time. From 1548

where, after 1550, examples are fairly numerous. In the Netherlands
also, beginning with the work of Hubert Goltzius at Bruges, they
are met with almost as frequently as in Italy. It was, perhaps,
Christopher Plantin at Antwerp who, more than any other printer, made
the engraved title-border the fashion for all larger and more important
publications. But it is with the seventeenth century especially that
engraved borders are associated. The Elzevirs used them even on their
pocket editions, while at the other extreme the massive volumes
issued at Amsterdam and at Paris in the reign of Louis XIV are almost
invariably introduced by an elaborate engraved frontispiece....</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p>Perhaps the worst examples of these overloaded frontispieces
are to be found in German books of the period. Often, also, the
engraved border is only a bastard title, the proper title page being
set up in type. The earlier examples, dating from the sixteenth
century, are in general the best, being simpler and not yet overburdened
with a mass of detail. The good taste of the eighteenth
century brought about a reform. But at Paris most books of this
period had a typographic title page and the work of the famous
school of French engravers was lavished on the illustrations.
However, the engraved vignettes of that age were often very
effectively used. Even Baskerville did not always disdain the
vignette, and it was the last form of decoration abandoned by
Bodoni.</p>
</div>

<p>One other form of decoration may be mentioned, that of metal
rules. Rules have been used occasionally at almost all periods, by
Geofroy Tory, for example, among others. But as far as title
pages are concerned they are found most often in the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p class="pc1 small1">THE DECEYTE OF WOMEN, A. VELE, LONDON, C. 1550.
The combination of black-letter and a woodcut is a usual title page in
an early English book. This undated example is probably mid-century, as
the printer, Vele, is not heard of before 1548. The cut seems to date
much earlier. (Size, 5-1/4x7-1/2 inches.)</p>

<p>The purely typographic title page is naturally of greater interest
to the modern producer of books. At all periods the title
page which was effective mainly by the arrangement of type has
been common, and at most periods there have been printers who
preferred to dispense with ornament of any kind. In the sixteenth
century the books of the Paris printer, Michel de Vascosan,
illustrate this severer manner, and the classical style of the great
printers at the close of the eighteenth century was likewise independent
of decoration. Some sort of arrangement of the letters
displayed on the title page suggested itself from the first, and
very soon various shapes were tried. Perhaps the commonest
arrangement was the conical one, or the so-called hour-glass
shape, in which the lines of type begin by being long, to become
short at the center, lengthening again in the imprint at the foot.
Others have preferred a natural arrangement, printing the matter
exactly as if on a page of the text. Geofroy Tory, a book producer
whose work was of great importance in the history of the book,
seems to have been against the fashion of his day in his choice of
the natural layout. It has certainly been the usual custom to
aim at some sort of pattern in the division of the lines of type.
In this respect the earlier printers had one advantage which was
not enjoyed by their successors. They felt no difficulty about
dividing a word in a title, even when the second part of the word
was to be set in a different size or even a different kind of type.
Frequently we find examples of such breaks in words as custom
has made impossible for the modern printer. The simplification of
the task for whoever was responsible for the layout is obvious.
One rule which seems to have been almost universally observed
is that the mass of the type must be in the top half of the page
and not evenly distributed. [<a href="#Page_69">Page 69</a>.]</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[Pg 62]</span></p>
</div>

<p>Equally important with the distribution of the matter is the
question of the kind of type to be used, the sizes of type, upper- or
lower-case, and the number of different fonts. The simplest
manner of using the letter employed in the text met with little
favour and was soon displaced by the use of larger types and
especially by the use of capitals. The heavy, square Roman capitals,
like those of Froben at Basle, for the first line, with smaller
capitals for succeeding lines, were more or less customary in
Northern Europe in the first quarter of the sixteenth century. In
some countries a mixture of a "lettre de forme" and Roman capitals
was not unusual at the same period. With the introduction
of the new Garamond romans at Paris about 1530 began the fashion
of using the Canon and Double Canon sizes of the lower-case
letters for titles. In the seventeenth century we find large and
heavy Roman capitals again in favour, often balanced by a woodcut
ornament or a basket of flowers. This century, undoubtedly
the worst in the history of typography, notwithstanding the Elzevirs,
is especially remarkable for its crowded title pages. It had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[Pg 63]</span>
become the custom to give as much information as possible about
the contents of the book and the qualifications of author, editor,
etc., and the printer took the opportunity of displaying as large a
variety of his types as possible. No doubt the use of title pages
as posters for advertising is partly responsible for the custom. It
has been established by documentary evidence that such methods
of advertising books were usual in England and in Germany, and
probably this was so in other countries also. Incidentally it may
be pointed out that the posting up of title pages accounts for some
of the early collections, such as that of Bagford, now in the
British Museum. Bagford has been attacked for his vandalism in
mutilating books for the sake of his hobby, but it now appears
that he may have been quite innocent of the charge. In any case
the result on the title page as a specimen of typographical arrangement
was deplorable....</p>

<p>With the eighteenth century title pages became simpler and
letters became lighter, and the result is again work as good in its
different style as that of the sixteenth century. The eighteenth
century is certainly a great period in the history of book production,
with its center in Paris. In England the influence of Caslon
and Baskerville at length raised our typography to a level with
Continental work. For one innovation P. S. Fournier is mainly
responsible, the introduction of outline and other decorative capitals
which were so successfully used at Paris. At the end of the
century we have the work of the Didots and Bodoni, the classical
school, whose technical achievement has hardly been surpassed
at any period. One may cavil at their conception of the
ideal shape of letters, one may dislike their excessive use of hair
lines and their flat serifs, but it must be admitted that as practical
printers and type-cutters their work was of first rate quality.
These classical printers were proud of their types and wished
them to stand alone. Bodoni, who at the beginning of his career
used ornaments copied from Fournier and engraved vignettes, in
his later years more and more abandoned decoration and outline
letters. The classical title page is composed in Roman capitals of
varying size, but without the admixture of lower-case letters or
italics and without the aid of decoration. Like Baskerville, these
printers considered that type is itself sufficiently interesting to
stand alone.</p>

<small>THE FIRST WORK WITH AMERICAN TYPES</small></h2>

<p class="p22 center small1">From <cite>Typographic Heritage</cite>. Copyright 1949 by The Typophiles.<br />
 Reprinted by permission of the author.</p>

<p>On 7 April 1775 there appeared in Philadelphia the initial issue
of Story &amp; Humphrey's <cite>Pennsylvania Mercury</cite>. This newspaper was
referred to by a contemporary diarist as "The first Work with Amer.
Types" and with certain qualifications, later to be made, it seems to
be entitled to the distinction of priority implied in this descriptive
phrase. Type founding in the colonies went through those phases of
tentative effort, complete failure, and partial achievement which are
normal to the beginnings of great industries, and before going on with
the story of the font of type from which the <cite>Pennsylvania Mercury</cite> was
printed, it is proposed to give briefly an account of earlier attempts
at the establishment of letter founding in English America. By doing
this it will be possible to secure correctness of sequence and of
relationship among the several elements of this study in origins.</p>

<p>The first font of types cast in English America was that which
resulted from the painful efforts of Abel Buell, a silversmith and
lapidary of Killingworth, Connecticut. Shortly before 1 April
1769 Buell cast a small font of letters, crude in design and in
execution, from which proofs were taken for the examination and
the criticism of his friends. In October of the same year, using a
different and much better type of his own making, he presented to
the Connecticut Assembly a printed petition in which he asked
that body for financial assistance in his proposed establishment of
a letter foundry. In reply to this memorial he received a loan from
the colony for the purposes of his venture, and soon afterwards he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[Pg 66]</span>removed to New Haven and prepared to manufacture type for the
printers of a continent. The story of his failure at this time, and
of his success on a much smaller scale twelve years later, is a part
of the present study only in the sense which has been indicated
in the introductory sentences.</p>

<p>Buell was not without a rival in his ambitious plans. David
Mitchelson of Boston, possibly acting under the direction of John
Mein, a printer of that city, is reported by a contemporary newspaper
writer to have attained as great a degree of success as the
Connecticut silversmith in the difficult art of letter casting. In the
<cite>Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News-Letter</cite> for 7 September
1769 there appeared among the local news items a report
on recent developments in American manufacturing activities in
which are certain sentences of interest in the story of colonial type
founding. "We are assured by a Gentleman from the Westward,"
said the writer, "that Mr. Abel Buell, of Killingworth in Connecticut,
Jeweller and Lapidary, has lately, his own Genius, made himself
Master of the Art of Founding Types for Printing. Printing
Types are also made by Mr. Mitchelson of this Town [Boston]
equal to any imported from Great-Britain; and might, by proper
Encouragement soon be able to furnish all the Printers in America
at the same price they are sold in England." The absence of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[Pg 67]</span>
known specimen of Mitchelson's letters or of any specific information
as to his operations is enough, however, to require a verdict of
"not proven" on any claim to priority in American type casting that
has yet been made on his behalf.</p>

<p>Because of the unfruitful nature of the enterprises which have
been spoken of, the year 1770 found the American printer still
dependent upon European importation for his printing type, and
at the moment there existed little prospect of relief from a situation
which in the years of the Revolution was to become a hardship
rather than the simple inconvenience of the earlier period. The
policy of non-importation, however, was stirring the colonies to
the establishment of local manufactures, and under the whip of
necessity, type founding, among other essential industries, was to
take its rise in the United States. The carrying to success of this
manufacture in Pennsylvania in the year 1775 was undoubtedly
assured by the political and economic situation of the country, but
its beginning, which must first be described, had its cause in a set
of circumstances of a more general character.</p>

<p>"The secular history of the Holy Scriptures," wrote Henry
Stevens, "is the sacred history of printing." In these words the
Vermonter gave sententious expression to the truth that the printing
of the Bible has been in all ages an appreciable factor in the
development of typography. The successful beginnings of type
founding in English America, it is believed, may be traced to the
desire of Christopher Sower Jr. of Germantown, Pennsylvania, to
issue a third edition of that German Bible which first had made its
appearance at the pains and expense of his father in the year 1743.
It is said that the younger Sower's dissatisfaction with the conditions
of type importation from Germany led him to conceive the idea of
importing thence matrices and moulds instead of finished type, and
with these placed in the cunning hands of Justus Fox, his journeyman,
of casting his own letters for use in the proposed edition of
<cite>Die Heilige Schrift</cite>. An enterprising man, a religious zealot, and the
proprietor of one of the most extensive printing offices in America,
he was able, partly at least, to carry out his intention.</p>

<p>The exact date of the first use by Sower of locally cast German
letters evades determination. Sometime in the year 1770, he began
the publication of the "second part" of a periodical known as <cite>Ein
Geistliches Magazien</cite>. The title page of No. <small>I</small>, Part <small>II</small>, of this early
religious magazine tells us that it was printed by Christopher Sower
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]<a id="Page_69"></a>[Pg 69]</span>at Germantown in the year 1770, and the undated colophon of No.
<small>XII</small> of the series contains information of singular interest in the
words, "Gedruckt mit der ersten Schrift die jemals in America
gegossen worden." The probability is that this issue of <cite>Ein Geistliches
Magazien</cite> was published late in 1771 or early in the ensuing
year. Upon the basis of this quoted statement and in view of the
knowledge that when his estate was sold in 1778 there were disposed
of to Jacob Bay and others certain lots of letter moulds, crucibles
and a large quantity of antimony<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> it becomes clear that Sower's
interest in type making developed well beyond the stage of thinking
it would be a nice thing to do.</p>

<p>The initiatory efforts of Sower have a particular significance in
the story of American type founding; for the tradition is that while
engaged in the casting process of type making in the Germantown
foundry, Justus Fox and Jacob Bay learned the more difficult mysteries
of an art in which later they attained proficiency. Because of
the link of continuous effort thus formed between Sower's initiation
of the business in 1770 and the later cutting and casting of Roman
letter by these artisans, there must be conceded to him the distinction
of having begun in English America the industry of type manufacturing,
regardless of whether or not his casting of German letter
from imported matrices was as extensive as has been supposed.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of Fox and of Bay is derived largely from the
<cite>Additions to Thomas's History of Printing</cite>, a body of tradition of
uneven reliability transmitted to Isaiah Thomas by William
McCulloch, a Philadelphia printer active in the early years of the
century. Selections from the six communications of the period
1812-1814 in which this information was transmitted were incorporated
by Thomas in the revision of his book upon which was
based the second edition brought out by the American Antiquarian
Society in 1874. Long afterward the series of letters was published
as a whole in the <em>Proceedings</em> of the Society for April 1921
under the title, <cite>William McCulloch's Additions to Thomas's History
of Printing</cite>.</p>


<p>In these letters to Isaiah Thomas, McCulloch was recording his
own memories and the accepted Philadelphia tradition. Because he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[Pg 70]</span>was well advanced in years at the time of writing, one is not surprised
to find that now and then he trips over the barrier that separates
documented fact from hearsay and personal recollection. It is
much to our comfort in the present instance, however, to learn that
he possessed and made use of unusual opportunities to obtain correct
information as to the craftsmen who are the subject of our
interest. These facts which he records of Justus Fox, for example,
he obtained from Emmanuel, the son and partner in type founding
of that artisan, and in <cite>Justus Fox, a German Printer of the Eighteenth
Century</cite>, Dr. Charles L. Nichols accepts his testimony as of
general reliability. He was indebted to various relatives of Bay,
among them a sister, "a plump lady of 68," for the account of him
which is found in the pages of the <cite>Additions</cite>. It is possible to compare
various items in McCulloch's sketches of these men with records
unknown to him, but available to us, with results so little at
variance that one is inclined to accord a high degree of credence
to all that he wrote concerning their activities.</p>

<p>At the time of Sower's importation of German equipment, McCulloch
informed Isaiah Thomas, he had among his journeymen an
ingenious general mechanic, Justus Fox, whom he charged with
the responsibility for casting the letters to be used in the great
Bible. In April 1772 he employed a newly arrived Swiss silk
weaver, Jacob Bay,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> to assist Fox. Two years later Bay left Sower's
service and set up a foundry on his own account in a near-by house
in Germantown. Fox remained in Sower's establishment, presumably
engaged in casting the large quantity of type required to
keep standing an edition of the Bible. In addition to this routine
work he is said to have cut and cast an unspecified amount of Roman
letter before 1774, the year of Bay's separation from the
Sower establishment. Working in his separate foundry, it is recorded
by our volunteer historian, Bay "cast a number of fonts,
cutting all the punches, and making all the apparatus pertaining
thereto, himself, for Roman Bourgeois, Long Primer, etc."</p>


<p>That this reported activity in type casting in Germantown about
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[Pg 71]</span>the year 1774 was not a play of the imagination on the part of its
historian is made certain by the definite statement that occurs in
one of the non-importation resolutions of the Pennsylvania Convention.
On 23 January 1775 the Convention "Resolved unanimously,
That as printing types are now made to a considerable
degree of perfection by an ingenious artist in Germantown; it is
recommended to the printers to use such types in preference to any
which may be hereafter imported."<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Referring somewhat vaguely
to this resolution, both as to content and as to origin, McCulloch
tells us that even at the time of its passage Fox and Bay each
claimed the honor implied in its terms. To this day the identity of
the "ingenious artist" remains uncertain.</p>

<p>It is not clear by what evidence it was known to the Convention
that "a considerable degree of perfection" had been attained in the
making of type in Germantown. The only known specimen of
printing type cast at that place before the meeting of the Convention
in January 1775 is the German letter employed in Sower's
periodical, <cite>Ein Geistliches Magazien</cite>, and it is not likely that this or
any other specimen of German type would have led the Convention
to a recommendation as sweeping as that which has been
quoted from its journal. It could only have been a Roman letter
that the delegates had in mind for a usage so general as was indicated
in their resolution, and we must remain in doubt as to what
specimen or specimens they had seen of locally cast type in this
character. It is certain, however, that at the time of their action a
font of Roman letter had been completed, or at any rate, that it was
then in the process of casting. It is quite possible that a trial specimen
of this font had been submitted to the Convention for its examination
and approval.</p>


<p>It is a satisfaction to be able to introduce the new font through
the medium of a contemporary reference to its use. We are indebted
to the correspondence and to the diary of the Rev. Ezra
Stiles of Newport, later President of Yale College, for some important
information on early American type founding. Excited by
Buell's efforts to make type in the year 1769, his interest in the
manufacture seems to have remained in being, for on 9 May 1775
he appended the following comment to an entry in his Diary: "Extracted
from the Pennsylv<sup>a</sup> Mercury, whose first N<sup>o</sup> was pub. the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[Pg 72]</span>7th of April last: printed with types of American Manufacture.
The first Work with Amer. Types: tho' Types were made at N.
Haven years ago."<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The fact that Ezra Stiles was one of the earliest
patrons of Abel Buell's venture in letter casting, supported as this
fact is by his interest in American manufactures generally, lends a
certain amount of weight to any observation that he might make on
the subject of American type founding, although it is probable that
he was ignorant of Sower's partial achievement of the art, just as
Sower some years earlier in his claim to priority had seemed to be
unaware of Buell's technically successful effort. If we may interpret
Dr. Stiles's words as meaning that Story &amp; Humphreys's
<cite>Pennsylvania Mercury</cite><a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> of 7 April 1775, Vol. <small>I</small>, No. <small>I</small>, was the
first published work printed in Roman letter which had been cut
and cast in English America, we may unhesitatingly repeat his description
of it as "The first Work with Amer. Types."</p>

<p>The Philadelphia newspaper which has been referred to is one
of the rarest of American journals of the period. Complete files,
comprising issues from 7 April to 27 December 1775, are found
only in the Library of Congress and in the Harvard College Library.
From the first page of its first issue, the publisher's announcement
is here reproduced.</p>

<p>A glance at the pages of the newspaper in which the new Roman
letter was first used makes us feel that in his commendable willingness
to admit imperfection the publisher paid small tribute to the
skill of his "ingenious artist." The letters of "rustic manufacture"
were far from perfect, it is true, and in later issues of the newspaper
it is observable that they had not worn especially well, but
nonetheless they composed agreeably and they were sufficiently
well executed to entitle them to something more than the half apology
with which they were offered to the public. Their interest,
however, as the first American-made Roman type to be used in a
publication intended for circulation transcends considerations of
worth and appearance.</p>

<p>Rejoicing in their encouragement of native manufactures, the
practical support they were giving to the Pennsylvania non-importation
resolutions of six months earlier, the publishers of the <cite>Mercury</cite>
advertised on 23 June 1775 <cite>The Impenetrable Secret</cite> as a
work "Just Published and Printed with Types, Paper and Ink,
Manufactured in this Province." If they had added, as possibly
they might have done with truth, "on a press of Philadelphia
make," we could regard this statement as the declaration of independence
of the American printer from the English manufacturer.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>


<p>Isaiah Thomas says that the <cite>Pennsylvania Mercury</cite> was established
with the backing of Joseph Galloway as a substitute for the
<cite>Pennsylvania Chronicle</cite>, that disastrous earlier venture in journalism
in which the Quaker politician had engaged with William Goddard.
If this was the case, certain features of the new publication
must have been displeasing to the silent partner, for Galloway the
Tory could hardly have rejoiced with the publishers in their virtuous
encouragement of native type founding, with all its patriotic
implications. Furthermore, from an advertisement of John Willis
and Henry Vogt in the first issue of the paper one learns that the
publishers were making use of other articles of printing equipment
made by these general craftsmen, who here announced their
ability to make presses and any and all of the mechanical appurtenances
required in a printing shop. This well-advertised Americanism
of the publishers, however, seems not to have availed them in
the attainment of success, and after their establishment had been
destroyed by fire in the closing days of the year the business was
never resumed.</p>

<p>It is not certainly known who was the maker of the significant
<cite>Mercury</cite> types. Assuming that Sower's foundry was in full operation
in the early months of 1775, we must assume also, in the absence
of knowledge to the contrary, that its principal activity was
in the manufacture of German letters for the great Bible, first published
in 1776, and that Sower would not have been likely to engage
in the making of Roman type on a large scale until this work
had been completed. Because of our ignorance of other possibilities
there remain to be considered only the two craftsmen, Fox and
Bay, as the probable makers of this first successful American letter.
According to McCulloch, Fox had cut and cast Roman letter at
some period before the year 1774 while still working for Sower.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[Pg 75]</span>
This statement contains all that is known of his efforts at making
Roman type during the years that he remained with Sower, but
there is the chance to be taken into account that the <cite>Mercury</cite> font
was the result of his experimentation during this period in an art
which later he pursued with no small degree of local success. On
the same authority it is said, it will be remembered, that Jacob
Bay had left Sower in 1774, and in a near-by house in Germantown
had set up a type foundry on his own account. In this separate
establishment, it is likely that he was able to devote to the business
such time and energy as would be required in making a font of
sufficient size to accommodate the needs of such a newspaper as
the <cite>Pennsylvania Mercury</cite>. The fact of his separate foundry having
been established sometime in 1774, the reference in the Convention
resolution of January 1775 to the "ingenious artist" at Germantown
and the appearance in April 1775 of the new font of type
acclaimed by the publishers as "an attempt to introduce so valuable
an art into these colonies" are considerations which, taken in their
order, seem to give ground for an assumption that it was Jacob Bay
who cut and cast the letters for "The first Work with Amer.
Types." Until proof is forthcoming, however, this must remain an
assumption and nothing more.</p>

<p>It is certain that both Fox and Bay maintained their interest in
letter casting for many years. At the sale of Sower's confiscated
property in the year 1778 both of these artisans were present as
purchasers of type-making tools and material.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Bay especially
seems to have taken advantage of the opportunity to secure equipment
at this dispersal of his old master's goods. Among other purchases
which he made at the sale of what was probably at the time
the largest typographical establishment in the country were "a lot
of letter moles" at three pounds, "a Box with 9 Crusibles" at £5
15<em>s.</em>, a quantity of worn type at 8<em>d.</em> a pound and antimony worth
£8 18<em>s.</em> 3<em>d.</em> He was living at the time in a house rented from
Sower,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and at the sale of the printer's real property in September
1779 he purchased another house belonging to the estate for
£4200, a sum which he paid in two installments before 28 October
1779.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In recording from tradition the fact that Bay secured at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span>this time one of the Sower houses, McCulloch asserts that he purchased
it from John Dunlap, the printer, whom he paid in type of
his own making. It is possible that he borrowed the purchase price
from Dunlap on this or a similar basis of repayment, a transaction
that would explain McCulloch's version of the story. It is said that
he conducted his foundry until the year 1789, and that between
this year and 1792 he sold the business to Francis Bailey. Fox continued
the making of type until his death in the year 1805, when
his son and partner Emmanuel Fox sold the equipment to Samuel
Sower of Baltimore, the son of Christopher Sower, the Second, of
Germantown, whose enterprise had been the determining cause of
its existence.</p>


<p>McCulloch was emphatic in his praise of the sturdiness of Fox's
types, but when he remarked to Archibald Binny upon the excellent
wearing quality of a set of figures and capitals cast by the Germantown
founder, which he and his father before him had been
using for many years, that gentleman replied with scorn that they
were "at first so devilish ugly ... the longest using cannot mar their
deformity."</p>

<p>The type-founding operations of Fox and of Bay have greater
importance in the history of the art in America than is usually conceded
them. When they are referred to at all by general writers,
their activities are mentioned briefly or in such a manner as to give
one the impression that their efforts were sporadic or tentative. It
is with the work of the Scotch founder Baine, using imported equipment,
that the story of American type founding is usually begun,
but with the <cite>Mercury</cite> font before us, cut and cast thirteen years before
Baine's first operations, and with assurances by McCulloch
that Fox cut and cast the letters used in the McKean edition of the
<cite>Acts of the Pennsylvania Assembly</cite>, printed by Francis Bailey in
1782,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and with references by McCulloch to fonts produced by
Bay, it seems certain that there exists material which will require
a revision of the story of American type-founding origins. Beginning
with the incontestable fact of the successful <cite>Mercury</cite> font of
1775 and accepting McCulloch's relation of later events as a working
hypothesis, there is seen to exist a field for research which
should prove productive of discoveries, inasmuch as the fact and
the tradition indicate a continuous activity on the part of one or the
other of these early Pennsylvania founders, Fox and Bay, from
1775 to 1805. In the course of these years other founders, better
known to us, began their work, and between the years 1796 and
1801, more than one hundred American printers, from Massachusetts
to Georgia, purchased type from the foundry of Binny &amp;
Ronaldson of Philadelphia.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The identification of the various fonts of locally made type used
in Pennsylvania in the quarter century following "The first Work
with Amer. Types" would form an interesting chapter in the story
of early American type founding.</p>

<p class="p1 center big1">Notes on the Long &#383; and other Characters in Early English Printing.</p>

<p class="center p22 small1">From <cite>An Introduction to Bibliography</cite> by Ronald B. McKerrow.<br />

<h3><em>The letters &#383; and s</em></h3>

<p>From the beginning of printing until towards the end of the
eighteenth century &#383; was used initially and medially and s
finally, following of course the practice of the MSS. There were
certain exceptions: Sweynheim and Pannartz, setting up the
first press in Italy at Subiaco in 1465, used a type transitional
in character though with marked gothic features, which used
the long &#383; in all positions, a practice which may have been
imitated from Neapolitan MSS. of the period. Other printers
sometimes followed the same usage in Roman type.</p>

<p>The first book to discard &#383; is said to have been Joseph Ames's
<cite>Typographical Antiquities</cite> of 1749, but this was regarded as an
eccentricity, and the normal &#383; is used in Herkert's edition of
1785-90. The effective introduction of the reform has been
credited to John Bell who in his <cite>British Theatre</cite> of 1791 used s
throughout, the same practice being followed in the Boydell
<cite>Shakespeare</cite>, of which vol. <small>I</small> appeared in 1792.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>It is worth noting that Capell in his <cite>Prolusions</cite>, 1760, had
attempted a modification of the usual practice. He there uses s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[Pg 79]</span>medially for a z-sound, retaining &#383; for an s-sound, thus:
easily, visible, rais'd, &amp;c., but ver&#383;es, pur&#383;uit, &#383;ati&#383;fy.</p>

<p>In London printing the reform was adopted very rapidly
and, save in work of an intentionally antiquarian character, we
do not find much use of &#383; in the better kind of printing after
1800. The provincial presses seem, however, to have retained
it somewhat longer and it is said to have been used at Oxford
until 1824.</p>


<h3><em>The letters i, j, u and v</em></h3>

<p>As a general rule, until early in the seventeenth century there
was only one capital letter, I (in Roman) or <img src="images/let_i-p79.jpg"  alt="" /> (in black-letter),
for the letters now represented by I and J; and only one capital
letter V (in Roman) or <img src="images/leth_p79.jpg"  alt="" /> (in black-letter) for the letters U and
V. As was pointed out by F. W. Bourdillon, this has in early
French books the odd result that a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">libraire juré</i> is liable to
appear in capitals as "I V R E." When reprinting a black-letter
text in Roman it seems logical to represent these by I and V in
all cases, though some editors have preferred to use J and U,
perhaps because the black-letter forms approximate more
closely to these letters in shape.</p>

<p>In lower-case most founts had i, j, u and v, but j was only used
in the combination ij (often a ligature) or in numerals, as xiij,
while v and u were differentiated according to position, not
according to pronunciation; v being always used at the beginning
of a word and u always medially.</p>

<p>Thus the following are the normal spellings: iudge, inijcere or
iniicere (= <em>lat.</em> injicere), vse, euent, vua (= <em>lat.</em> uva). Certain
printers varied the practice in a few books, but the rule followed
by most was absolutely rigid. It is quite incorrect to say that
the letters were used indifferently, or that the sixteenth-century
usage was the converse of the modern.... Rimes and puns show
that the Elizabethans <em>called</em> V by the name we now give to U
(hence W is called double-u). I have failed to discover the
originator of the modern name "ve...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>In England no example of the distinction [between i and j,
u and v] seems to have been found earlier than J. Banister's
<cite>History of Man</cite>, printed by John Day in 1578. The new method
is followed in a few other books of Day, and in 1579-80 we
find it followed by Henry Middleton in reprinting a Latin Bible
from a Frankfurt edition in which the distinction had been
made. From that time onwards to the end of the century we
find a certain number of books following the new system either
completely or with certain modifications, and thereafter the
number gradually increased until between 1620 and 1630 it
became the general rule.</p>

<p>The majuscule U at first employed was of the general design
of the lower-case u with a small tail or serif at the foot (which
has been revived in some modern fonts). The modern U begins
to come into use in English printing about the middle of the
seventeenth century.</p>


<h3><em>The letter w</em></h3>

<p>In early fonts this is often represented by vv. In later times
the same is often found in fonts of extra large size (presumably
of foreign origin), and in ordinary fonts when there happened
to be a run on the w and the compositor had not enough.</p>


<h3><em>Ligatures</em></h3>

<p>Two or more letters joined together, or differing in design
from the separate letters, and cast on one type-body, such as
 <img  src="images/ct.jpg"  alt="" /> or &#64259;, are called a ligature. There were two reasons for their
being so cast, custom and convenience.</p>

<p>In the early fonts the great majority of the ligatures were
due to custom alone and represented a following of scribal
practice which commonly joined together certain pairs of letters.
Thus in the fount used by Caxton in the <cite>Dictes and Sayings of
the Philosophers</cite> we find such ligatures as ad, be, ce, ch, co, de,
en, in, ll, pa, pe, po, pp, re, ro, te, &amp;c., all of which owe their
existence solely to imitation of MSS. of the time. Many of these
customary ligatures persisted throughout the sixteenth century,
and even later in black-letter founts ... while a few have combi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[Pg 81]</span>nations
with certain capitals such as Ch, Sh, Th, Wh.... Even in
Roman founts we find <img src="images/ct.jpg"  alt="" />, &#xA74F;, &amp;c., of which <img src="images/ct.jpg"  alt="" /> has persisted until
modern times. In Italic fonts we also find <em>es</em>, <em>us</em>, <em>&#64262;</em>, and others.
(The original Aldine Italic had many more.)</p>

<p>When a letter part of which overhangs the body of the type,
such as f or <img src="images/f-lig.jpg"  alt="" />,
happens to be followed by such an upright letter
as l or h, or by an i, the overhanging part or "kern" of the first
letter comes in contact with the top of the second, and either
the two types do not fit together properly or the kern of the
first letter gets broken off. To avoid this, most fonts even at
present have ligatures of f with l, i and another f (the end of the
curve of the first letter or the dot of the i being suppressed),
and of &#64256; with l and i. In early times these ligatures for convenience
included also a set with &amp;#383;. The f and
<img src="images/f-lig.jpg"  alt="" /> ligatures are
also presumably copied from the MSS., where they frequently
occur, though not in all hands....</p>


<h3><em>Punctuation marks</em></h3>

<p>/ In quite early fonts this sign is used for the comma, or
perhaps we should rather say to indicate any short pause in
reading.... The modern comma seems to have been introduced
into England about 1521 (in Roman type) and 1535 (in black-letter).
It occurs in Venetian printing before 1500.</p>

<p>? The query mark seems to have been used in England from
about 1521.</p>

<p>; The semicolon seems to have been first used in England
about 1569, but was not common until 1580 or thereabouts.</p>

<p>. The full stop was commonly used <em>before</em> as well as <em>after</em>
Roman, and sometimes also arabic, numerals until about 1580.
Thus ".xii." It was also used before and after i (.i. = id est) and
&#383; (.&#383;. = scilicet), and I have found it once with q = cue: "as
though his .q. was then to speake."</p>

<p>‘ and ’ were used indifferently in such abbreviations as th’
or th‘ for ‘the.’ It may be noted that ‘t’is’ or ‘t‘is’ (instead
of ‘ ’tis’) was so common in the Elizabethan period that it
should perhaps be regarded as normal.</p>

<p>" Inverted commas were, until late in the seventeenth century,
frequently used at the beginnings of lines to call attention
to sententious remarks. Modern editors have occasionally regarded
such passages as <em>quotations</em> and completed the quotes,
which is generally wrong. So far as I have observed they were
not especially associated with quotations until the eighteenth
century, although, owing to their use for calling especial attention
to a passage, they often appear in passages which are
actually quoted.</p>

<p>Even after they become clearly used to mark quotations they
generally appear at the beginning of the passage and at the
beginning of every line, but not always at the <em>end</em>. The practice
of closing the quotation with two apostrophes seems to be
comparatively modern. (I have found it in the middle of the
eighteenth century, but it does not seem to have been regularly
observed until much later.)</p>

<p>Inverted commas, as well as many other signs, Greek letters
(sometimes inverted) &amp;c., were used in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century
printing as reference marks directing to side- or
footnotes.</p>

<p>( ) were often used in the sixteenth century where we now
use quotation marks, and were indeed the general way of indicating
a <em>short</em> quotation, e.g.:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"she was neuer heard to giue any the lie, nor so much as to
(thou) any in anger."&mdash;S<small>TUBBES</small>, <cite>Christal Glasse</cite>, 1591.</p></div>

<p>They also seem sometimes to be used merely for emphasis, e.g.:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"What yesterday was (<em>Greene</em>) now's seare and dry"&mdash;C<small>OOKE</small>,
<em>Greene's Tu Quoque</em>, 1614.</p></div>

<p>[ ] Square brackets are common in some Elizabethan fonts,
being used as we now use round ones. They were also sometimes
used instead of round ones for the purposes mentioned above;
e.g.:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"which is as much as [of olde] or [in times past]."&mdash;P<small>LUTARCH</small>,
<cite>Morals</cite>, 1603.</p></div>

<p>Metal-flowers were the fir&#383;t ornaments u&#383;ed in printed books,
to be &#383;et at the head of the fir&#383;t page and the tail of the la&#383;t page,
as well as at the head and tail of any &#383;eparate part of the whole
work, and they were &#383;ometimes u&#383;ed as an edging to the matter
according to the ta&#383;te of the author or the printer, they were
u&#383;ed &#383;paringly and with &#383;mall variety, but in time they became
more numerou&#383;, and were cut in &#383;everal &#383;hapes, forms and devices,
and continued in reputation till <cite>Cutters in Wood</cite> &#383;upplanted
them, when <cite>Mr. Moxon</cite> wrote they were accounted old-fashioned.
but the u&#383;e of them was revived by the <em>French</em> and
<em>Germans</em> and the variety of them con&#383;iderably encreased by
the Two <em>Mr. James's</em> in <em>England</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>flower</em>-matrices in their foundery have been divided into
<em>old</em> and <em>new</em>, which to be &#383;ure is a divi&#383;ion, but &#383;uch as conveys
nothing or a fal&#383;e idea to the under&#383;tanding.</p>

<p>We are to ob&#383;erve then that the latter, though mo&#383;tly now
in vogue, are mere figures of fancy, made up of circular oval and
angular turns, contrived to look light, airy and unmeaning, and
to try the genius or patience of a compo&#383;itor.</p>

<p>But the former expre&#383;&#383;ed &#383;ome meaning and were adapted to
other purpo&#383;es than barely to dress and decorate a page. they
were formed from real objects natural and artificial, civil and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[Pg 84]</span>military, as from weeds and flowers of the field and garden,
leaves, branches, fruits, flower-ba&#383;kets, flower-pots, urns, cro&#383;&#383;es,
banners, launces, &#383;words, and tilting &#383;pears, and other &#383;amples
culled from the fields of nature and of heraldry; yet germane to
the &#383;ubject matter of the work.</p>

<p>They were frequently emblematical and monitory; as cherubs'
faces for the hymns of charity girls, hour-gla&#383;&#383;es for lugubrious
orators, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mort</i>-heads for the pari&#383;h-clerks. they were &#383;ymbolical
of nations; as the crown and ro&#383;e, the crown and lyz, the
crown and harp;&mdash;of dignities and orders; as diadems, crowns,
mitres and coronets; the red hat called at <em>Camb.</em> the <em>Cardinal's
cap</em>, where too the mitre is called the <em>golden night-cap</em>; the
courtelass; the arms of <em>Ul&#383;ter</em>, and the anchor of hope; the <em>Scotch</em>-thi&#383;tle
and &#383;prigs of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue</i>; both <em>&#383;ub</em>-&#383;ymbolical; the former rendered

tedious here.</p>

hath been seen in Europe, the Wit of Man did never invent any
Thing that was either more lucky, or more useful for Instruction.</p>

<p>This Truth is so universally acknowledged, that it needs no
Proof: Every one knows, that, without this marvellous Art, the
Studies, Labours, and Works of great Men, would have been of no
Use to Posterity. We are then obliged to this Art, for the Knowledge
of the Works of the old Philosophers, Physicians, Astronomers,
Historians, Orators, Poets, Lawyers, Theologues; and, in a
Word, of all that hath been writ upon any Art, and Science whatsoever.
It is by the Means of PRINTING that Theologues do
attain to the sacred Mysteries of our Religion; That the Doctors of
Law, do teach those admirable Laws, which do regulate the Society
of Men; That Historiographers do furnish us with Examples,
which we are either to follow or shun; That Astronomers do make
every Day such fine Discoveries in the Heavens. It is this very Art
which furnisheth Physicians with Means to preserve and recover
the Health of Man's Body; Which discovereth to Philosophers
the more hid Secrets of Nature; Which furnisheth Geometricians
with Ability to measure the Earth; And to Arithmeticians, to
give every Man his Due. In fine, what would the Moderns know
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[Pg 86]</span>in any one Science, and Art, if PRINTING did not furnish
them with All that the Ancients found out? All the Elogiums
which we make of PRINTING, and the Honours which we
pay to It, come far short of It's Merit: And we cannot but easily
consent to this, if we consider the vast Expences which the Ancients
were obliged to be at, in procuring Manuscripts....</p>

<p class="center p1"><em>THE PUBLISHER'S PREFACE TO THE<br />
PRINTERS IN SCOTLAND</em></p>

<p><em>Gentlemen</em>,</p>

<p><em>That Men are not born for themselves, but for the Republick,
is an ancient and universally applauded Maxim. And it is so agreeable
to right Reason, that the wisest and best Part of Mankind,
in every Age since the Creation, have endeavour'd to lay the
Foundation of a lasting good Name, by every Action of their
Life; whereby they might improve the Body or Society of which
they were Members. To this Principle it is, that we owe the Invention
or Improvement of all the Arts and Sciences that are
instructive or beneficial to Man. 'Mongst which the Invention,
and vast Improvement, of the no less honourable, than useful and
admirable Art of PRINTING, which we profess, deserves a
very eminent Place: Since by It, all Sorts of Learning, Sacred or
Profane, and every Kind of profitable Instruction and Invention
are both publish'd and preserv'd; as my Author, I here give you
the Translation of, shews clearly and copiously enough.</em></p>

<p><em>This Book, being the History of the Beginning and Advancement
of our Art, shews the Character of the Men who first profess'd
It, the Marks of Honour paid them, wilst alive; nay, and the
Monuments rais'd to preserve their Memories after Death. By all
which 'tis plain, That those illustrious Persons were honour'd,
and ranked among the best of their fellow Citizens, in those
Times: Whereas now we are scarcely class'd or esteem'd above
the lower Forms of Mechanicks. How we came to lose that Honour
and Respect due to our Profession, (since the present Age is
much more learned, and I believe, as just too, and discerning of
Merit as their Ancestors) shall be a little inquir'd into. But first
let me give some general Account of this Work.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p><em>It bears the Title of</em>, The History, <em>&amp;c.</em> of our Mysterious
Art; <em>and the Author, with great Exactness and Candor, fairly
shews the Claims, Reasons and Authority supporting them, on
both Sides, in the lasting Contest betwixt the Towns of</em> Mentz <em>and</em>
Harlem; <em>for the Glory of the Invention. A clear Mark, what a
solid Honour 'tis esteem'd for a Town to have been the noble
Theatre, where so wonderful an Art was first brought to Light.</em></p>

<p><em>He next gives the Names of the first learned Printers, together
with a Catalogue of the Works printed by them, and the
Marks of Honour paid to them by their Fellow-Citizens and
Country-Men; which will more than enough justify what I have
affirm'd above.</em></p>

<p><em>The Author wrote in</em> French, <em>and I have caus'd translate it
for my own, and the common Benefit of these practising the Art
in this Part of</em> Britain; <em>without proposing any other Advantage
or Gain by it, but the Improvement of the Art, or at least raising
It to the Pitch of Perfection It was at here in former Times. And
since we are, I trust, all of us honest Men, and of better Spirits
than to propose the Earning our Bread as the chief and only End
of our Labour; I entertain a settled well grounded Hope, that the
Perusal of this, will inspire us all with a noble and generous Emulation
of equalling, nay, exceeding, if we can, the best Performances
of our laudable Ancestors in the Employment. That since
our Native Country has at present as many good Spirits, and
Abundance of more Authors than in any former Age; we may
make it our Ambition, as well as it is our Interest and Honour, to
furnish them with Printers that can serve them so well, that they
need not, as many of our former Authors have been forc'd to do,
go to other Countries to publish their Writings, lest a learn'd
Book should be spoil'd by an ignorant or careless Printer.</em></p>

<p><em>Thus, Gentlemen, we shall have this Honour, which is truly
more valuable than immense Sums of Money or opulent Estates,
that, for the Glory of our Country, we have retrieved the Art of
PRINTING, and brought It to as great Perfection as ever It
was here in former Times....</em></p>

<p>Printers are usually judged as printers, and there are those
who hold that this is as it should be, that the printer should stick
to his pica rule and follow copy out the window. But in their
spare time printers also eat, vote, marry and go to war. It would
therefore be possible to look at them from various points of view,
as, for instance, how many were vegetarians, anarchists, bigamists
and top sergeants. This could be so of any group of craftsmen. If
we look at printers from another viewpoint, as to whether they
were men of the world, it is because of the nature of the stuff with
which they work.</p>

<p>I should like to begin obliquely by speaking first of an approach
to the history of printing. Probably the history of printing is more
limited, definite and easy to encompass than that of almost any
subject. That is not to say that anyone can ever learn all of it, or
that we cannot go on learning something new about it all our
lives. But printing started fairly recently in time; it is its own
record. Excluding the science of bibliography, the literature is not
large compared, for example, with that of art or philosophy or
geology. Yet few people know as much of it as they might know
with pleasure, and perhaps the reason for that might be a faulty
approach. It is customary to send beginners to study Updike, but
it is easy for beginners to get bogged down in <em>Printing Types</em>,
particularly if they start to read it from the beginning. Updike's
magnificent work is, in its writing and its outline, gratifying to
the student whose basic knowledge has been fixed and matured.
Beginners move more freely in the pages of George Parker Win<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[Pg 89]</span>ship,
possibly because he related printing events to world events
to a greater extent than does Updike. Usually the person who
wishes to learn more about printing has already at hand a lot of
names and dates and places vaguely relating to world events of
the past. To such a person printing history lends itself readily to
the method of study by association. It can be a good game to find
out what was happening in printing when Napoleon was looking
at the Pyramids, or when Charles I was beheaded. If one is
interested in art, he can correlate artists and printers, and find
that Leonardo was born about the same time that printing was
born in Europe, or he can correlate printing with advances in the
knowledge of medicine or agriculture. There are small but interesting
links between the history of printing and that of music.
For instance William Caslon the elder loved music, and it is possible
that the composer Handel sometimes played his new pieces
at the concerts held in Caslon's organ room, since the two men
had mutual friends in the musical world of London.</p>

<p>There have been printers who were interested in other worlds.
The Dutch printer Blaeu studied astronomy under Tycho Brahe,
and himself produced in 1600 a celestial globe. The Scottish type-founder
Alexander Wilson, although educated as a doctor, became
interested in type and left a considerable foundry to his sons
before he himself moved on to become professor of astronomy at
the University of Glasgow.</p>

<p>If you wish to make the most of this method, you must do it
yourself. Then it is you who will have the fun, and then what you
learn will stick. What follows illustrates the method briefly by
looking at a number of printers in the past five hundred years
from one angle, judging them not simply as printers but as men
of the world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It would be nice if we could start with a definition of "man of
the world" and a definition of "printer" but actually this small
investigation is an attempt at definition. We cannot mean "man
of the world" in the Chesterfieldian sense, although there have
been many printers who knew how to dress and carry themselves
in court and salon, notably Aldus, Caxton and members of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[Pg 90]</span>
Didot family. Chesterfield would be obliged to allow some of our
printers in his company, but I doubt if we could allow him in ours,
for in one of his letters to his son he says, "Due attention to the
inside of books and due contempt for the outside is the proper
relation between a man of sense and his books." Perhaps he was
thinking of the vanity of fancy bindings, though it is more likely
that he was beguiling himself into one of those untruths common
to aphorizers. However that may be, our man of the world does
not mean gentleman of the world as Chesterfield thought of gentleman,
although there are printers who are both&mdash;not all dead.</p>

<p>If we were to speak of the printer as a citizen of the world, we
would be coming a little closer to it, but citizen implies being at
home in the geographical world, whereas we are thinking of him
being at home in the world of ideas. When we say "of" the world,
we mean that he knows that he belongs to his contemporary
world, that the people and events are of interest to him, the politics,
art, science and poetry&mdash;not only some particular dexterity, professional
specialization or money-making device of his own.</p>

<p>It might be argued that the bulk of printing has not now, and
never has had, much relation to ideas, that in the early days its
chief business was dubious theological disputes and that its chief
business now is advertising soap flakes and the like. But printing,
in its entirety, is a description of the world, and if a great deal of
print is devoted to murder cases, toothpaste ads and income tax
blanks&mdash;well, that must be the kind of world we have. However,
when new ideas have been advanced, they have been advanced in
print, so that the printer has never been safe from them. Even
now, in the event that they be promulgated by radio, they must
be fixed in print in order to stick and sink in. Let us only say then
that with regard to gaining knowledge of the world in which we
live, the printer is in an exposed position&mdash;nothing more.</p>

<p>Although we do not know much about Gutenberg,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> the first</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[Pg 91]</span></p>
<p>printer, we doubt that he was a man of the world in our sense.
How could he have been? For the preceding four or five hundred
years to be a man of the world was to be unworldly; people had
been concerned with building cathedrals, making religious paintings,
going on crusades. Printing was the chief factor in making
the man of the world in our modern sense. Printing enabled him
to know what was going on so that he might take part in it, although
printers did not realize this during the cradle days of
printing. Great events were occurring then; the Turks captured
Constantinople; the Hundred Years' War came to an end with the
English driven off the continent of Europe; the Portuguese sailed
to the Canaries and the Azores; but these events found little mention
in early printing. <cite>The Nuremberg Chronicle</cite>, as Helen Gentry
and David Greenhood point out in their <cite>Chronology</cite>, made no
mention of Columbus' discovery of America in the previous year.
First came religious books, then school books, law books and
classics. It is true that Fust and Schöffer printed proclamations and
information for the archbishop, but it was not until Von Olpe at
Basle printed <cite>The Ship of Fools</cite> in 1494 that we have "a book
dealing with contemporary people and their exploits instead of
with historical accounts of the past."</p>

<p>Although Gutenberg had been involved in the politics of Mainz
in his youth, probably he thought of nothing but printing after
he began work on his invention. We have an old book of stories
for children which describes Gutenberg in a dream: "He thought
of the great harm which might be done through the printing of
bad books&mdash;how they would corrupt the minds of the innocent,
how they would stir up the passions of the wicked. Suddenly he
seized a heavy hammer and began to break his press in pieces.
But then a voice seemed to come from the press itself saying,
'Hold your hand, John Gutenberg. The art of printing will enlighten
the world.'" I have no idea where the author could have
found source material for this little fantasy, for we can feel quite
sure that Gutenberg had little conception of the influence of his
invention. He was all craftsman and inventor and carried his
world in his head. His financial reverses alone would indicate that.</p>

<p>The word "printer" has been an elastic word from the very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[Pg 92]</span>
beginning, including scholars and artists, businessmen and craftsmen.
If we were to consider the term "printer" narrowly in the
sense of a typesetter or a pressman or a man who supervises these
operations, we should still have to make room in our history for
men like Jean Grolier, the patron, and Geoffroy Tory, the artist.
We know of many printers who were first and last businessmen.
Johann Fust was a banker until he put money in Gutenberg's
project. The first English printer, Caxton, was a retired wool
merchant who liked to translate French romances for his friends
and became tired of writing them out in longhand. Anton Koberger,
who was Dürer's godfather, the publisher of <cite>The Nuremberg
Chronicle</cite> and a great entrepreneur in his day, began as a
printer; he printed books in various languages, did sub-contracting
and printed advertising circulars. Probably if the plain motives
of most printers could be discovered, making a living would loom
large.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There have been many printers who were also scholars, beginning
with Aldus and including the Estiennes and the Didots. And
there are the typecutter-printers who combined letter-founding
and printing&mdash;Nicolas Jenson, Giambattista Bodoni, John Baskerville,
as well as the names equally brilliant in printing history
of those who devoted themselves to founding&mdash;Claude Garamond,
William Caslon and the Fourniers. A general haze surrounds the
subject of the contribution of less well-known type-cutters to printing.
Although the use of a distinguished type may be one of the
chief reasons for the printer's success, compare the fame of the
printer Aldus with that of his type designer, Francesco da Bologna,
of John Bell with that of Richard Austin, of Thomas Bensley with
that of Vincent Figgins, of Bulmer with William Martin, of Elzevir
with Christoffel van Dyck, of François Ambroise Didot with
that of Waflard. On the subject of the share which these printers
had in suggesting the nature of the type to the men who cut it,
typographical writers are almost consistently inexplicit, although
we do know that William Martin brought his types with him
when he started work for Bulmer. Even Updike, who gives credit
to the type designer and cutter wherever he is known, says, "At<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[Pg 93]</span>
first the best printers were often type-founders too, although Garamond
merely (<em>sic!</em>) cut and cast type for the use of others."
Binders and papermen, ink-makers and machinery manufacturers
have always had an affectionate and proprietary air about printing.
Rather than try to define "printer" strictly, it may be truer to
say that printers are an adjectival lot, and that printing can honorably
be a very inclusive term, but that we might have a new
printing terminology which would better define the various
contributions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What was happening in the world about the year 1500 when
Aldus Manutius<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> had his great printing shop in Venice working
at its peak? Columbus had made several voyages, and the Portuguese
had been around the tip of Africa although Magellan had
not yet sailed around the world. Leonardo da Vinci had left Milan
for political reasons, and was working in Venice, as was Giovanni
Bellini and his pupils Titian and Giorgione. Northern Italy was
the scene of much brawling between rival princes, with Emperor
Maximilian I stepping in now and then to make things worse.
The battles were nuisances to Aldus, for they interfered with the
production and distribution of his books. I do not know how much
he knew about the geographical discoveries of his time, but we
can be sure that a man of his cultivation knew about the great
painting and sculpture being done. Ralph Roeder says of this time
that its "triumphs are preserved in art, its reverses in its spiritual
story, and both are the result of the same cause&mdash;its supreme
vitality."</p>

<p>It is one more indication of that vitality that Aldus at the age of
forty embarked on a project which was to bring about a tremendous
enlargement of the conception of the purpose of books. Many
printers in history have drifted into printing or its allied trades by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[Pg 94]</span>chance, but there seems to be no doubt that Aldus knew exactly
what he was doing all the time. He was a man who knew what he
wanted. He had been a scholar and tutor to Alberto and Lionello
Pio, princes of Carpi, when he first saw printed books and realized
what could be done to make classical manuscripts generally available.
With the aid of the Pio family he went to Venice, which,
since the fall of Constantinople, had been the richest repository of
manuscripts and a residence of Greek scholars. In order to have
reference books available for his proof-readers and editors, he first
printed a Greek dictionary and a Greek grammar and himself
prepared a Greek-Latin dictionary. He gave Venice a university
when he started the New Academy of Venice. For his press he
hired the finest scholars of the day&mdash;Bembo and Reuchlin, Musurus
and Erasmus. We, in the twentieth century, have a tendency to
think of scholars as removed from the affairs of life. Aldus was a
scholar who was also in the midst of life, because scholarship was
an important affair in the world of Renaissance man. He must
have been a true cosmopolitan as well, commanding, as he did,
the friendship of men as different as Erasmus of Rotterdam and
Jean Grolier of France, from whom he had a commission to print
special copies of his books on vellum.</p>

<p>The 1500's were a time of religious bickerings and of religious
wars, of Henry the VIII's break with Rome, of the German wars
following the death of Martin Luther, and the Inquisition in Spain.
In the early part of the century there was working at Lyons, which
was then second only to Paris as a printing center in France, a
young scholar and printer named Etienne Dolet.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> There is a story
that he was the illegitimate son of Francis I, but at any rate he
came of a wealthy family, having been to Venice as secretary to
the French Ambassador and to Toulouse to study law. By the
time he was twenty-seven he had published a Latin Dictionary
which was "one of the most important contributions to classical
scholarship in the century" and was given a license by Francis I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[Pg 95]</span>providing that Dolet might print for ten years any books written
or supervised by him. His great range of taste and interests may
be judged by the fact that he printed the New Testament in Latin
and Rabelais in French.</p>

<p>He had met Rabelais when he first went to Lyons to work under
Sebastian Gryphius as proof-reader, and there gained his practical
knowledge of printing under the foreman, Jean de Tournes. E. D.
Christie, Dolet's biographer, says that Dolet, arriving in Lyons
with a fever, may have been taken directly to Rabelais, who was
at that time practising medicine, with the position of Physician
to the Great Hospital. Christie also thinks it possible that Dolet
may have seen Rabelais perform a dissection on a man's body ten
years before Vesalius. Everything Dolet did shows him to have
been a man with lively fearless intellect and no talent for playing
safe and keeping out of trouble. He spent several terms in jail for
lack of orthodoxy on religious questions, was pardoned by Francis
I for killing a man, and was denounced by Rabelais for printing
an unexpurgated edition of <cite>Pantagruel</cite> after Rabelais had fixed it
up to suit the Sorbonne.</p>

<p>At Lyons in the months of April and May, 1539, there occurred
the first large organized printers' strike. It was no wonder, for
Updike says that it was not unusual for the printers' day to begin
at two in the morning and last until eight or nine at night. The
workmen said that the masters did not supply sufficient food, that
wages had been reduced, that there were too many compulsory
holidays. The Seneschal of Lyons was empowered to meet a committee
of journeymen and one of masters; at this conference rules
were drawn up. But the trouble spread to Paris, and as a result of
arbitration there, the working day was set from five in the morning
till eight at night. Then there was a flare-up at Lyons again because
the master printers threatened to move away; this was some
years in settlement.</p>

<p>Of all the master printers of Lyons, the only one who sided with
the strikers was Dolet. This was held against him later when he
was imprisoned on a charge of atheism, tortured, hanged and
finally burned on his thirty-seventh birthday. (See <cite>Chronology of
Books and Printing</cite>.) On his way to his death he made a Latin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[Pg 96]</span>
pun on his name. If we speak of him as a man of the world, the
accent is on man.</p>

<p>It is said that it was this event&mdash;the burning of Dolet&mdash;which
decided Christopher Plantin<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> to leave France in 1548 for Antwerp,
though Plantin never exhibited the uncompromising attitude of
Dolet; rather he showed a business toughness and adaptability
which enabled him to survive and stay in this world, which was
no small feat for a printer in the sixteenth century. It was a time
when empires and ideologies were in tremendous conflict; the
period of the German religious wars following the death of Martin
Luther; of Spain and England in unrelenting struggle for control
of the sea, culminating in the destruction of the Spanish Armada
in 1588. Antwerp itself was a focal point of disorder after Philip II
sent the Duke of Alba to subdue the Netherlanders. Plantin had
built up a good printing and publishing business when, in 1562,
it was liquidated because of his alleged unorthodoxy. Within a
few years he had recovered to the extent that he was made Printer
to the King of Spain, from whom he received assurances of help
on his Polyglot Bible. Again, in the sack of Antwerp by Spanish
soldiers in 1576 his business was all but ruined; he went to Leyden
for a few years, but returned to finish his days at Antwerp. To a
man living in those times, the issues must have seemed even more
confused and difficult than ours do now. Recent investigations
indicate that Plantin belonged to a sect of heretics for which he
printed books secretly, while also doing books for the church.</p>

<p>Another sixteenth-century printer who could hardly be oblivious
to the events of his time&mdash;he was so knocked about by them&mdash;was
Robert Estienne.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Even though he was at one time Royal Printer,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[Pg 97]</span>liked and respected by Francis I, he sometimes had to seek the
sanctuary of the King's court to escape the King's censors. Robert
must have been a man of stature, for he published his <cite>New Testament</cite>
in defiance of the Sorbonne, and only after Francis I died
did he leave Paris for Geneva. He was a believer in one of the
springs of Renaissance thought&mdash;that through scholarship it is
possible to come to the truth, and through printing all men may
recognize and know the truth.</p>

<p>It would be possible for a man of the world to be so without ever
stirring from the town of his birth, yet oftener than not the man
with breadth of interest is a cosmopolitan and a traveller. Such
cosmopolitans were fourteen members of the Elzevir<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> family,
who, over a period of one hundred and thirty years, engaged in
printing and selling small books chiefly intended for poor scholars.
This Dutch family of practical internationalists established their
bookshops and printing offices in nearly every large city on the
continent, from Denmark to Italy, printing their books in Latin
and Greek, French and Arabic, on subjects ranging from medicine
to political science. All this in spite of the Thirty Years' War,
which was to bring about the decline of the artificial internationalism
of the Hapsburgs and the Holy Roman Empire, and in spite
of similar disturbances before and after.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the geographical
boundaries of printing were extended vastly outside of Europe.
The colonization of North and South America was going forward.
The first press in America had been established at Mexico City in
1539 by agents of Kromberger of Seville. European printing was
carried to India in 1561, to China in 1589, and to Japan in 1591.
The first printing was done in Russia in 1563.</p>

<p>Credit for doing the first printing in the American colonies,
<cite>The Freeman's Oath</cite>, was once given to Stephen Daye, is sometimes
latterly given to his young son, Matthew Daye. Were they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[Pg 98]</span>more than mechanic, compositor and pressman? Who chose the
copy, proofread it, set policies, pushed the work along? Possibly
some of the founders of the new Harvard College, or possibly Mrs.
Glover, the widow of the man who originated the idea of the
press. She was probably a woman of education, since she settled
in Cambridge to be near the new college and later married the
President, Henry Dunster. She undoubtedly shared her first husband's
independent views&mdash;he had been suspended from his parsonage
in Surrey because of his nonconformity; she might have
picked <cite>The Freeman's Oath</cite> for the first copy. She may have been
more of a printer and more of a woman of the world than the
fragments of knowledge which we have about her disclose....
Whoever guided the destiny of the first press, it was a person not
completely confined by dogma, for the books included almanacs,
law books and college thesis lists, as is pointed out by Carl Purington
Rollins, himself perhaps our best example of a modern fine
printer conscious of what is going on around him.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the late 1700's the Industrial Revolution began, but its
implications were not guessed by artisan or statesman, and the best
printers were still in the age of elegance. Baskerville was businessman,
eccentric, free-thinker, but his printing, as much as that of
Bodoni who was employed by the Duke of Parma, was regal.</p>

<p>Probably Horace Walpole,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> more than any other printer, felt
that the world was his house, in which he could move about freely
from room to room, always at ease. He had the wit and manners
to be an ornament to French salons, the originality to introduce
a new brand of literature in his <cite>Castle of Otranto</cite>&mdash;the forerunner
of our mystery novel of today, the personal force to influence the
trend of English architecture with his "little Gothic castle" at
Strawberry Hill in Twickenham. In one of his letters to the artist
Richard Bentley he says that he can't resist going to fires, and
there is something of this spirit in his activities. The collector
W. S. Lewis says, "He was not only, in his own word, a 'gazetteer'
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[Pg 99]</span>but the historian of English painting and gardening, an essayist,
poet, novelist, pamphleteer, dramatist, printer, antiquarian, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arbiter elegantiarum</i> and in the modern sense and phrase a 'debunker'
of historical figures.... It was his main purpose in life
to be the official historian of his time."</p>

<p>Although he had a seat in Parliament, he paid little attention to
the nation's business. He represented those parts of life in the
eighteenth century which had natured and were drawing to a
close, as Fielding and Goldsmith, the American Revolution and
the French Revolution represented things to come. Printing being
one of his minor activities, he is of more interest as a human being
than as a craftsman.</p>

<p>If Walpole was a man of the world and man of letters, John
Bell<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> was man of the world and man of business. During a lifetime
of eighty-six years he was, as Stanley Morison pictures him,
book-seller, printer, publisher, type-founder and journalist. Like a
lesser Franklin&mdash;he had not Franklin's scientific interest, integrity,
or vision&mdash;he was endowed with the ability to grasp the salient
facts of a trade or profession, and a wealth of exuberant interest in
life around him. At the beginning of his career as a book-seller, he
published a sort of early version of Wilson's <cite>Cumulative Book
Index</cite>, a list of current books for the use of the trade. As type-founder
(and introducer of the short "s") he employed the talent
of the punch cutter Richard Austin to produce the first English
"modern" type. In addition to a successful fashion magazine, he
published at different times four newspapers. At one time he even
made himself a war correspondent, when he visited the British
Army then fighting the French Revolutionaries in Flanders. He
reported the action at Ypres, made a march with the troops from
Courtrai to Tournai and pursued his object of finding "active and
well-informed persons in different parts of the continent" who
would act as regular correspondents for his paper, <cite>The Oracle</cite>.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[Pg 100]</span>
The books he published included law books, Shakespeare, a series
of the poets of Great Britain; he engaged members of the Royal
Academy to illustrate the plays of a series called <cite>The British
Theatre</cite> and hired the best engravers of the day to copy the paintings.
He knew the literary men of the day&mdash;Sheridan wrote for
his <cite>World</cite>&mdash;and even had a balloonist for a friend&mdash;Lunardi, who
made the first ascent in London. Compared to his contemporary
Bulmer, who could be called a printer's printer, Bell was a promoter
whose medium was printing.</p>

<p>Of all the Didots, and they seem to have been able men, Firmin
Didot<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> is of most interest to us. He taught many of the printers of
Greece out of sympathy for the cause of Greek independence, the
same for which Byron died. He wrote plays, translated classics,
and after he retired from business he entered the Chamber of
Deputies; he learned Spanish at the age of sixty-three. Desmond
Flower says, in writing of him, "Printing is a curious and perhaps
unsatisfactory hybrid between a profession and an art; the men
who have caught the sense of it most successfully have been intelligent
people who could see it whole&mdash;scholar-printer-publishers&mdash;for
whom some other rivers flowed beyond the simple floods
of printing ink." Perhaps when Mr. Flower wrote this he had
forgotten how "tacky" printing ink is, but his meaning is a large
part of what I am trying to say.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The question of what world one chooses to recognize&mdash;that of
courts and salons or of slums&mdash;arises in connection with the great
printer of the nineteenth century, William Morris.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> He saw what
was happening as a result of machinery and large industry, and
he did not like it. He must have seen it very plainly in order to
revolt against it so strongly. His printing period was the last in his
life, following the chintzes, stained glass windows, tapestries, rugs
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[Pg 101]</span>and furniture. He felt that people would be better people if they
made and owned beautiful things, and he also saw, like his contemporary,
Karl Marx, that the economic structure would have
to be changed before the best qualities in people could operate,
though he was not willing to follow Marx in his methods. When
we think of the William Morris who printed the Kelmscott
<cite>Chaucer</cite>, we do not always remember the William Morris who
stood in Hyde Park near the Marble Arch talking to the street
crowds about socialism, wondering if the police were coming;
who for years travelled about speaking in a thousand stuffy halls
in England, Ireland and Scotland. When he was old, tears would
come to his eyes when the misery of the poor was mentioned. It is
easy to say that his socialism was vague and his desire to return to
the methods of the thirteenth century unrealistic, but considering
the sincerity of his motives and the breadth of his interests, I think
that we must say that he was not so much a man of this world as
a man of a better world.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>Perhaps we must return to America to find the printer who has
made the greatest contribution to political history. We can hardly
detail here the cosmopolitan accomplishments of Benjamin Franklin.
We might rather examine what right we have to call him a
printer, in view of the magnitude of his other accomplishments.
He liked to think of himself as a printer, and started his will with
the words, "I, Benjamin Franklin, printer." Once when he visited
the establishment of the Didots in France he stopped at a hand
press and pulled a few proofs. When the workman exclaimed at
his dexterity he said, "Do not be surprised. Printing is my real
trade." Wherever he went in England or France he corresponded
with printers and visited their establishments. We know about his
private press at Passy and about his wholesome influence on American
printing. Carl Van Doren, in his biography of Franklin, says
that when he died the printers of Philadelphia walked in his
funeral procession and that the printers of Paris gathered to honor
him, listened to a eulogy by one of them while others set it in type
as fast as it was delivered and distributed printed copies as souvenirs.
If then we can claim him as a printer, we can feel sure that
the man who helped draft the Declaration of Independence, who
was sent to negotiate the peace and was a delegate to the Constitutional
Convention was, more than any other printer, a man of the
world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It could hardly be maintained that being connected with printing
makes one a man of the world. It might even be argued and
proved by examples past and present that preoccupation with the
problems of the craft is a narrowing influence. Since most of the
circumstances of our lives are arranged for us when we are born,
it is possible to travel through life as on a conveyor belt, having
things done to us along the way, and this can be as true of a fine
printer as of a bank president. Each can go through life utterly
ignorant of the economic and mental processes that bring food to
his table and send his son to the wars. It was always a question,
now more than ever critical, what part of a man's life must be
given to being a citizen against the claims of livelihood, philosophy,
family and amusement. The events of the past few years
have dramatized the dilemma. Printing has helped bring us to
this place in history. And so, although we cannot condemn a good
craftsman because he is interested in nothing except shop talk, we
might say that printers who are also men of the world realize that
they are working in a bigger shop.</p>

of printing, but his biography is written darkly only in the records of the
law courts to which he was constantly summoned on money matters. His was a
complex of inventions: he not only cast type in single pieces, but devised a chase

scholar and printer combined to produce tools for humanism: dictionaries, lexicons,
grammars, editions of the classics. On his death his son Henri Estienne, grandson
of the first Henri, augmented the family tradition of scholarly publishing, though
he never surpassed the books of his father and grandfather in typographical
brilliance.</p></div>

of production and distribution of quantities of books for a variety of readers
throughout Europe.</p></div>

<em><small>Are Women the Natural Enemies of Books?</small></em></h2>

<p class="center p22 small1">From <cite>Bookmaking on the Distaff Side</cite> by Anne Lyon Haight. Copyright 1937
by the author and reprinted by her permission.</p>

<p>In my search for knowledge about lady bibliophiles I climbed
the library ladder and among the books on collecting saw <cite>The
Library</cite>, by Andrew Lang, London, 1881. Confident that I
would find some charming and sympathetic essay on the subject, I
took it down and turned to the index, but evidently I had forgotten
Lang's prejudice, for to my horror the startling lines
"Women the natural foes of books" met my eye. They were
classed with the other enemies of books: damp, dust, dirt, book-worms,
careless readers, borrowers, book stealers, book-ghouls,
etc., so I hastily turned to the page and read: "Almost all women
are the inveterate foes, not of novels, of course, nor peerages and
popular volumes of history, but of books worthy of the name. It
is true that Isabelle d'Este and Madame de Pompadour and Madame
de Maintenon were collectors; and, doubtless, there are many
other brilliant exceptions to a general rule. But broadly speaking,
women detest the books which the collector desires and admires.
First, they don't understand them; second, they are jealous
of their mysterious charms; third, books cost money, and it really
is a hard thing for a lady to see money expended on what seems
a dingy old binding, or yellow paper scored with crabbed characters.
Thus ladies wage a skirmishing war against book-sellers'
catalogues, and history speaks of husbands who have had to
practise the guile of smugglers when they conveyed a new purchase
across their own frontier. Thus many married men are reduced
to collecting Elzivers, which go readily into the pocket,
for you cannot smuggle a folio volume easily."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[Pg 104]</span></p>
<p>Poor man, his experience with the fair sex must have been a
very unfortunate one. Perhaps he had been disillusioned by reading
of the sixteenth-century abbess of the convent of Rumsey
in Hampshire, whom Dibdin tells about. She was bibulously
rather than bibliographically inclined and bartered the books
of the abbey for strong liquors and consequently was accused of
immoderate drinking, especially in the nighttime when she invited
the nuns to her chamber to participate in these excesses. But
fortunately the women whom Lang describes in his diatribe are
really the rare exception to the rule and only lack of space prevents
my writing a folio volume about the many famous women
collectors who have been friends not foes to books throughout the
ages.</p>

<p>It is true though that the female of our species has never been
as susceptible to the malady of book madness as the male, possibly
because she has not had the same opportunity. Unless a woman
is economically independent there are many demands upon her
allowance and consequently she must really want a book very
much to buy it instead of a new hat or something else that is dear
to her heart. She is not as apt to buy for speculation or because
a book is one of the conventional collector's items, but is more
independent and adventurous in following her personal taste,
although the spirit of a true collector of books is the same whether
it be possessed by man or woman.</p>

<p>Strange to say, the first bibliophile on record is a woman. She
was a Benedictine abbess named Hroswitha. She lived in the Nunnery
of Gandersheim in Saxony in the tenth century. She not
only read all the parchment rolls and great codices which came
into her hands, but caused books to be written for her Convent,
wrote plays in Latin and translated Terence. Hroswitha probably
knew but little Greek, as certain monks of the period considered
the language an invention of the devil. Her example was
followed in the next century by the lovely and intelligent Countess
Judith of Flanders, who, wherever she followed her warring
English husband, caused the most exquisite illuminated manuscripts
to be made. She continued her interests on the continent
when she later married the Duke of Bavaria. Four of her manuscripts,
magnificently bound, are now safely housed in the Pierpont
Morgan Library where "though they are books worthy of
the name" their beauty may be appreciated by women who are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[Pg 105]</span>
not even "the brilliant exception to the general rule" of collectors.</p>

<p>The Golden Age of women bibliophiles in France from the
fifteenth through the eighteenth centuries must have been a glorious
time to have lived. The Queens, the Princesses, the Mistresses
of the Kings and all the great ladies had their libraries. They were
composed of beautifully illuminated breviaries, missals and manuscripts,
and from the presses of the great printers of the day came
romances, histories, plays and religious books, veritable works of
art. These books and manuscripts were bound in gold and silver
and jewels, embroidered velvet, and in some of the most beautiful
leather bindings the world has ever seen. Briefly: Marguerite of
Navarre was one of the famous scholars of her day and the author
of a collection of love stories, <cite>The Heptameron</cite>. It is said of her
"L'amour du livre, chez la fille de Catherine fut une véritable passion."
Her books were bound by the famous Clovis and Nicolas
Eve and were decorated with daisies. Madame de Pompadour was
for many years an inspiring influence in art and letters, although
she owned more plays, novels and other "productions légères"
than serious works. She had a printing press at Versailles and also
etched plates for illustrations and as gifts for her friends. La
Countesse de Verrue was a discriminating collector, a patroness
of all the arts and a fascinating woman. The Du Barry acquired
1,068 volumes. When she began to form her library she could
scarcely read or write. However, with practise, she soon learned
to read well, but like many of us never to spell. Anne of Austria
was fortunate in having her friend Mazarin, a kindred spirit in
bibliomania, to advise her. Marie Antoinette had two libraries.
She kept her particular books in her boudoir in the Trianon and
the titles in the catalogue are very entertaining. Mary Stuart had
a catholic taste in literature and her books were exceptionally
well chosen. In deference to the loss of her first husband some
were bound in black with black edges. It is comforting to know
that when she left France as a young widow to return to her
native Scotland where so much tragedy awaited her "qu'elle
avait pour les livres un goût profond, et ils etaient pour ainsi dire
sa seule consolation loin de ce beau Pays de France." In England,
one of the most fortunate of the many ladies who appreciated
literature was Queen Elizabeth, for she lived in an age when
masterpieces were being written, many of them dedicated to her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[Pg 106]</span>
and many inspired by her. When she was young she embroidered
velvets in gold and silver threads to bind her treasures. Among the
manuscripts in the Bodleian Library are the <cite>Epistles of St. Paul</cite>,
etc., which was Elizabeth's own book. She has written at the beginning
"I walke many times into the pleasant fields of the Holy
Scriptures, where I plucke up the goodlie-some herbes of sentences
by pruning: chaw them by musing: and laie them up at
length in the hie seate of memorie by gathering them together:
that so having tasted their sweetness I may the less perceave the
bitterness of this miserable life."</p>

<p>One of the most touching and beautiful tributes ever written
to a woman is Sir Philip Sidney's dedication of his <cite>Arcadia</cite> to his
"deare ladie and sister," the Countess of Pembroke, to whom he
wrote in part: "you desired me to do it, and your desire, to my
hart is an absolute commandment. Now it is done onely for you,
onely to you." She was his great inspiration and helped him in
the editing of the book.</p>

<p>Where there's a will there's a way and women seem able to
smuggle folios as well as duodecimos into the library. Catherine
de Médici, for instance, had such a passion for books that she
got them by fair means or foul. She longed for the library of her
cousin Marshal Strozzi and as soon as he died appropriated it for
her own. Catherine neglected to pay for it and owed the book-sellers
as well, so after her death when her books were about to be
seized by her creditors, De Thou raised the money to pay for
them and they were saved for the state. The fascinating and glamorous
Diane de Poitiers was a practical business executive as well
as a bibliophile, for it was she who supposedly advised Henry II
to pass an ordinance requiring publishers to present a copy of
each book they published to the royal libraries at Blois and Fontainebleau,
thereby increasing these collections by more than
seven hundred volumes. Thus the present-day copyright law was
initiated by a woman. Catherine of Russia was also courageous
in her methods of gratifying her literary tastes. She partitioned
Poland in 1772 and seized enough books to form the foundation
of the Imperial Library at the Hermitage. She used to ask the
Ambassadors, particularly the Ambassador from England, to get
foreign books for her and if she did not have the money to pay for
them at the time she conveniently forgot about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>In later days there were women in the young colony in America
who enjoyed their books in the midst of their primitive surroundings.
In 1643 in Emans, New York, the inventory of the
Widow Bronck included Danish books. Mrs. Willoughby of
Virginia left over one hundred volumes at her death in 1673, and
in 1700 Elizabeth Tatham of New Jersey left five hundred and
fifty-two volumes, while their New England contemporary,
Hannah Sutton, acquired a library of about seventeen hundred
volumes.</p>

<p>In the early nineteenth century Miss Richardson Currer of
Eshton Hall, Craven, Yorkshire, amassed a large and scholarly
collection of books on many subjects. It was housed in a great
room with a gallery which must have been the envy of all book-lovers.
She was the fond possessor of the rare <cite>Book of St. Albans</cite>,
written and compiled by Juliana Berners, prioress of the nunnery
of Sopwith in Hertfordshire. It is said that the ardent book collector
Richard Heber, being unable to secure the book in any
other way, ardently proposed marriage to Miss Currer. She was
firm in her refusal however, preferring to keep this first book
about sport to be written by a woman to herself.</p>

<p>One of the most learned lady bibliophiles of this century in
America was Miss Amy Lowell of Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Her books and manuscripts, including her collection of Keats,
are being preserved for posterity in the Harry Elkins Widener
Memorial at Harvard. She always enjoyed smoking a good cigar
while writing or carrying on her sparkling conversations, as she
thought it made her thoughts flow more easily.</p>

<p>One could not write of women in connection with books without
speaking of two distinguished custodians of famous libraries,
scholars, who are as well known abroad as in America: [the late]
Miss Belle Da Costa Greene, the brilliant Director of the Pierpont
Morgan Library, and Miss Ruth Sheppard Granniss, former
Librarian of the Grolier Club and sympathetic friend of all
bibliophiles, male or female. They, of course, come under Lang's
category of exceptional examples.</p>

<p>But what of the many other exceptions? Would Lang have
thought that Miss Lowell could not understand books? Or that
Diane de Poitiers could be jealous of their mysterious charms?
Or that Catherine of Russia would hesitate to spend what money<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[Pg 108]</span>
she could procure to satisfy her passion for them? What could
his lady friends have been like to be classed with the enemies of
books&mdash;and such enemies at that?</p>

<p>It would appear that book collecting is a truly feminine pastime,
containing many elements which appeal to their sex; romance,
intellectual curiosity, love of the beautiful and the quest
of something difficult to obtain. But feminine collectors should
beware of pitfalls, for sometimes this mania arouses the baser
instincts such as envy, extravagance and self-indulgence. Wives
have even been known to spend their marketing money on books
instead of daily bread, and to waste hours reading book catalogues
instead of attending to their housewifely duties. Book collecting,
however, is a common denominator of all ages and a medium
through which the minds of both sexes may meet with pleasure,
and therefore greatly to be recommended as a delightful occupation.</p>

<small>PRINTING SHOULD BE INVISIBLE</small></h2>

<p>Imagine that you have before you a flagon of wine. You may choose
your own favorite vintage for this imaginary demonstration, so
that it be a deep shimmering crimson in color. You have two goblets
before you. One is of solid gold, wrought in the most exquisite patterns.
The other is of crystal-clear glass, thin as a bubble, and as transparent.
Pour and drink; and according to your choice of goblet, I
shall know whether or not you are a connoisseur of wine. For if you
have no feelings about wine one way or the other, you will want the
sensation of drinking the stuff out of a vessel that may have cost ten
thousand dollars; but if you are a member of that vanishing tribe, the
amateurs of fine vintages, you will choose the crystal, because everything
about it is calculated to <em>reveal</em> rather than to hide the beautiful
thing which it was meant to <em>contain</em>.</p>

<p>Bear with me in this long-winded and fragrant metaphor; for you
will find that almost all the virtues of the perfect wineglass are parallel
in typography. There is the long, thin stem that obviates finger-prints
on the bowl. Why? Because no cloud must come between your
eyes and the fiery heart of the liquid. Are not the margins on book
pages similarly meant to obviate the necessity of fingering the type-page?
Again: the glass is colorless or at the most only faintly tinged
in the bowl, because the connoisseur judges wine partly by its color
and is impatient of anything that alters it. There are a thousand mannerisms
in typography that are as impudent and arbitrary as putting
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[Pg 110]</span>port in tumblers of red or green glass! When a goblet has a base that
looks too small for security, it does not matter how cleverly it is
weighted; you feel nervous lest it should tip over. There are ways of
setting lines of type which may work well enough, and yet keep the
reader subconsciously worried by the fear of "doubling" lines, reading
three words as one, and so forth.</p>

<p>Now the man who first chose glass instead of clay or metal to hold
his wine was a "modernist" in the sense in which I am going to use
that term. That is, the first thing he asked of this particular object was
not "<cite>How should it look?</cite>" but "<em>What must it do?</em>" and to that extent
all good typography is modernist.</p>

<p>Wine is so strange and potent a thing that it has been used in the
central ritual of religion in one place and time, and attacked by a
virago with a hatchet in another. There is only one other thing in the
world that is capable of stirring and altering men's minds to the same
extent, and that is the coherent expression of thought. That is man's
chief miracle, unique to man. There is no "explanation" whatever
of the fact that I can make arbitrary sounds which will lead a total
stranger to think my own thought. It is sheer magic that I should be
able to hold a one-sided conversation by means of black marks on
paper with an unknown person half-way across the world. Talking,
broadcasting, writing and printing are all quite literally forms of
<em>thought transference</em>, and it is this ability and eagerness to transfer and
receive the contents of the mind that is almost alone responsible for
human civilization.</p>

<p>If you agree with this, you will agree with my one main idea, <em>i.e.</em>,
that the most important thing about printing is that it conveys
thought, ideas, images, from one mind to other minds. This statement
is what you might call the front door of the science of typography.
Within lie hundreds of rooms; but unless you start by assuming
that <em>printing is meant to convey specific and coherent ideas</em>, it is very easy
to find yourself in the wrong house altogether.</p>

<p>Before asking what this statement leads to, let us see what it does
not necessarily lead to. If books are printed in order to be read, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[Pg 111]</span>
must distinguish readability from what the optician would call legibility.
A page set in 14-point Bold Sans is, according to the laboratory
tests, more "legible" than one set in 11-point Baskerville. A public
speaker is more "audible" in that sense when he bellows. But a good
speaking voice is one which is inaudible <em>as</em> a voice. It is the transparent
goblet again! I need not warn you that if you begin listening to
the inflections and speaking rhythms of a voice from a platform, you
are falling asleep. When you listen to a song in a language you do
not understand, part of your mind actually does fall asleep, leaving
your quite separate aesthetic sensibilities to enjoy themselves unimpeded
by your reasoning faculties. The fine arts do that; but that is
not the purpose of printing. Type well used is invisible <em>as</em> type, just
as the perfect talking voice is the unnoticed vehicle for the transmission
of words, ideas.</p>

<p>We may say, therefore, that printing may be delightful for many
reasons, but that it is important, first and foremost, as a means of
doing something. That is why it is mischievous to call any printed
piece a work of art, especially fine art: because that would imply that
its first purpose was to exist as an expression of beauty for its own
sake and for the delectation of the senses. Calligraphy can almost be
considered a fine art nowadays, because its primary economic and
educational purpose has been taken away; but printing in English
will not qualify as an art until the present English language no longer
conveys ideas to future generations, and until printing itself hands its
usefulness to some yet unimagined successor.</p>

<p>There is no end to the maze of practices in typography, and this
idea of printing as a conveyor is, at least in the minds of all the great
typographers with whom I have had the privilege of talking, the one
clue that can guide you through the maze. Without this essential
humility of mind, I have seen ardent designers go more hopelessly
wrong, make more ludicrous mistakes out of an excessive enthusiasm,
than I could have thought possible. And with this clue, this purposiveness
in the back of your mind, it is possible to do the most
unheard-of things, and find that they justify you triumphantly. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[Pg 112]</span>
is not a waste of time to go to the simple fundamentals and reason
from them. In the flurry of your individual problems, I think you
will not mind spending half an hour on one broad and simple set of
ideas involving abstract principles.</p>

<p>I once was talking to a man who designed a very pleasing advertising
type which undoubtedly all of you have used. I said something
about what artists think about a certain problem, and he replied with
a beautiful gesture: "Ah, madame, we artists do not think&mdash;we <em>feel</em>!"
That same day I quoted that remark to another designer of my
acquaintance, and he, being less poetically inclined, murmured:
"I'm not <em>feeling</em> very well today, I <em>think</em>!" He was right, he did think;
he was the thinking sort; and that is why he is not so good a painter,
and to my mind ten times better as a typographer and type designer
than the man who instinctively avoided anything as coherent as a
reason.</p>

<p>I always suspect the typographic enthusiast who takes a printed
page from a book and frames it to hang on the wall, for I believe that
in order to gratify a sensory delight, he has mutilated something infinitely
more important. I remember that T. M. Cleland, the famous
American typographer, once showed me a very beautiful layout for
a Cadillac booklet involving decorations in color. He did not have
the actual text to work with in drawing up his specimen pages, so he
had set the lines in Latin. This was not only for the reason that you
will all think of, if you have seen the old typefoundries' famous
<cite>Quousque Tandem</cite> copy [<em>i. e.</em>, that Latin has few descenders and thus
gives a remarkably even line]. No, he told me that originally he had
set up the dullest "wording" that he could find [I dare say it was from
the <cite>Congressional Record</cite>], and yet he discovered that the man to
whom he submitted it would start reading and making comments
on the text. I made some remark on the mentality of Boards of Directors,
but Mr. Cleland said "No: you're wrong; if the reader had not
been practically forced to read&mdash;if he had not seen those words suddenly
imbued with glamor and significance&mdash;then the layout would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[Pg 113]</span>
have been a failure. Setting it in Italian or Latin is only an easy way
of saying 'This is not the text as it will appear.'"</p>

<p>Let me start my specific conclusions with book typography, because
that contains all the fundamentals, and then go on to a few
points about advertising.</p>

<p>The book typographer has the job of erecting a window between
the reader inside the room and that landscape which is the author's
words. He may put up a stained glass window of marvellous beauty,
but a failure as a window; that is, he may use some rich superb type
like text gothic that is something to be looked at, not <em>through</em>. Or he
may work in what I call transparent or invisible typography. I have
a book at home, of which I have no visual recollection whatever as
far as its typography goes; when I think of it, all I see is the Three
Musketeers and their comrades swaggering up and down the streets
of Paris. The third type of window is one in which the glass is broken
into relatively small leaded panes; and this corresponds to what is
called "fine printing" today, in that you are at least conscious that
there is a window there, and that someone has enjoyed building it.
That is not objectionable, because of a very important fact which has
to do with the psychology of the subconscious mind. This is the fact
that the mental eye focusses <em>through</em> type and not <em>upon</em> it. The type
which, through any arbitrary warping of design or excess of "color,"
gets in the way of the mental picture to be conveyed, is a bad type.
Our subconsciousness is always afraid of blunders [which illogical
setting, tight spacing and too-wide unleaded lines can trick us into],
of boredom, and of officiousness. The running headline that keeps
shouting at us, the line that looks like one long word, the capitals
jammed together without hairspaces&mdash;these mean subconscious
squinting and loss of mental focus.</p>

<p>And if what I have said is true of book printing, even of the most
exquisite limited editions, it is fifty times more obvious in advertising,
where the one and only justification for the purchase of space is
that you are conveying a message&mdash;that you are implanting a desire,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[Pg 114]</span>
straight into the mind of the reader. It is tragically easy to throw
away half the reader-interest of an advertisement by setting the simple
and compelling argument in a face which is uncomfortably alien to
the classic reasonableness of the book-face. Get attention as you will
by your headline, and make any pretty type pictures you like if you
are sure that the copy is useless as a means of selling goods; but if you
are happy enough to have really good copy to work with, I beg you
to remember that thousands of people pay down hard-earned money
for the privilege of reading quietly-set book-pages, and that only
your wildest ingenuity can stop people from reading a really interesting
text.</p>

<p>Of course every one of you realizes that whatever interesting
effects you can produce with displayed advertising, Direct Mail is
your paradise. It is here that you approach the august precincts of the
designer of books; here you can deal in the fascinating questions of
paper, ink, presswork, and all those minute and thrilling technicalities
by which the craftsman proves his worth. You also have the satisfaction
of knowing that the better and more mannerly Direct Mail
advertising looks, the more solid returns it will bring in.</p>

<p>To sum up: printing demands a humility of mind, for the lack of
which many of the fine arts are even now floundering in self-conscious
and maudlin experiments. There is nothing simple or dull in achieving
the transparent page. Vulgar ostentation is twice as easy as discipline.
When you realize that ugly typography never effaces itself,
you will be able to capture beauty as the wise men capture happiness
by aiming at something else. The "stunt typographer" learns the
fickleness of rich men who hate to read. Not for them are long
breaths held over serif and kern, they will not appreciate your splitting
of hair spaces. Nobody [save the other craftsmen] will appreciate
half your skill. But you may spend endless years of happy experiment
in devising that crystalline goblet which is worthy to
hold the vintage of the human mind.</p>

<cite>The Ideal Book</cite></h2>

<p class="p22 center small1">Copyright 1931 by The Limited Editions Club. Reprinted by permission of
the publisher.</p>

<p>In adopting a prescribed title for this paper, I must begin by
registering my dissent to its validity. There is no such thing nor
can there be such a thing as "the ideal book." No single book, no
particular style of book can be said to represent in itself an ideal
below which all other books and other styles which differ from
it fall. A certain book may be ideal for its purpose, but books
can no more conform to a fixed ideal than can churches, cocktail-shakers,
or hats. The best that one can do is to attempt to
enumerate and codify those elements of good book-making that
enter into what may be called the "fine" book.</p>

<p>It is difficult to declare oneself an advocate or exponent of fine
printing or fine book-design without being misunderstood. Such
a declaration, however, is not to arrogate superiority. It merely
means that one believes in certain principles of craftsmanship and
in upholding certain standards based upon a scrupulous and uncompromising
observance of refinements and minutiæ. It is a
mistake to assume that the word "fine," as applied to printing and
to books, is a comparative term meaning a grade or measure of
merit. Consider for a moment its true meaning: delicate, studied,
subtly calculated. It represents not a grade of excellence, but a
<em>quality</em>, a quality distinguishing those books and pieces of printing
which the term properly describes from other books or pieces
of printing. It may be allowed, however, that fineness is itself a
comparable term; that there are, in other words, degrees of fineness.
Thus a book may be fine without being of the first order of
fineness. But if we are to seek for a standard of excellence equivalent
to what is implied by the word "ideal," it should be obvious
that only fineness of the first order can be considered. A fine
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[Pg 116]</span>book of the first order is the end-result of a sedulous effort on the
part of designer, printer, and binder to bring to their artifact
every care for physical and technical details, every revision in
the interest of betterment, of which they are capable, to the end
that the finished product shall represent the capacity of each for
the fulfilment of his artistic wish, his desire for perfection. To
slacken this effort, to compromise wittingly (or wilfully), to
surrender to expediency, is to repudiate fineness of the first
order.</p>

<p>It is this concern for perfection that Mr. Stanley Morison means
when he says "The fine printer begins where the careful printer
has left off." It is this concern with perfection that Conrad celebrated
when he wrote:</p>

<p>"Now the moral side of an industry, productive or unproductive,
the redeeming and ideal aspect of this bread-winning, is the
attainment of the highest possible skill on the part of the craftsman.
Such skill, the skill of technique, is more than honesty; it is
something wider, embracing honesty and grace and rule in an
elevated and clear sentiment, not altogether utilitarian, which
may be called the honor of labor. It is made up of accumulated
tradition, kept alive by individual pride, rendered exact by professional
opinion, and, like the higher arts, it is spurred on and
sustained by discriminating praise. This is why the attainment
of proficiency, the pushing of your skill with attention to the
most delicate shades of excellence, is a matter of vital concern.
Efficiency of a practically flawless kind may be reached naturally
in the struggle for bread. But there is something beyond&mdash;a
higher point, a subtle and unmistakable touch of love and pride
beyond mere skill; almost an inspiration which gives to all work
that finish which is almost art, which <em>is</em> art."</p>

<p>In dealing with the constituents of the fine book I intend no
disparagement of seemly, modest, and honestly-made books to
which the term "fine" is not strictly applicable. Even the humblest
volume, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad pauperum commoditatum</i>, may be, by virtue of
its suitability to purpose and its seemliness, wholly admirable.
As for the better class of trade books, the productions of university
and great commercial presses, they often display qualities
of design and workmanship of a high order. Though not of the
first order of fineness, they represent, with gratifying frequency,
what Conrad called "efficiency of a practically flawless kind."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[Pg 117]</span>
That the best of them belong, however, to a lower stratum than
the truly fine book may be, I think, quite easily demonstrated.
One does not have to consider the work of the Doves Press or
the Bremer Presse or the finer examples of French printing of the
sixteenth or eighteenth century the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne plus ultra</i> of book-making
in order to recognize in them a quality (mark the word) which
the trade edition, however charming, never does and never can
attain. By reason of this quality&mdash;the quality of fineness&mdash;they are
<em>different</em> from trade books, whether or not they are <em>superior</em> must
remain for each of us a question of personal values. Since that is
true, let us now&mdash;having cleared the ground and removed perhaps
the possibility of a misapprehension with regard to the title of this
paper&mdash;consider the values and the physical constituents of the
fine book.</p>

<p>These constituents fall into three divisions: first, <em>Dimensional</em>
(size and proportions); second, <em>Tectonic</em> (plan and construction);
and third, <em>Visual</em> (appearance).</p>

<p>It would be absurd to contend that, ideally, a book should be
of a certain size. Very large books are, of course, awkward to
handle and are unsuitable, let us say, for reading in bed or in a
railway train. But it does not follow that, because our habits of
life differ so radically from those of the more leisurely and contemplative
past, the tall volume is no longer justified. The large
book is not an impediment to meditative reading and, although
the "handy volume" will, in most circumstances, serve every purpose,
there are those who, undeluded by pragmatism and undebased
by false ideas of efficiency, may still, in the seclusion of
study or library, find pleasure in the leisurely perusal of, let us
say, <cite>The Golden Legend</cite>, in folio, nobly enthroned upon its lectern.
Again, there is nothing incongruous or unpractical about
the scholar (perhaps I should say, "research-worker") making
use of a huge volume, spread before him on a library table. Large
volumes are, moreover, frequently justified by the fact that illustrative
plates of a large size are often desirable or essential. Who
will deny that reproductions of Egyptian papyri, of eighteenth
century engraved portraits, of Oriental carpets, in fact, of almost
all works of art other than such small objects as miniatures or
jewelry, would be better in folio than in octavo or duodecimo?
It can be said, I think, that the very large book should be unconditionally
condemned only when its size defeats the purpose to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[Pg 118]</span>
which, by reason of its content, it would normally be put. Stateliness
of form imparts dignity. It may be argued, therefore, that
a great work on engraved gems, imposing in size, with plates,
each showing many specimens, comports better with the character
of its subject matter quite aside from any advantage it offers
for comparative study, than would the same work printed as a
book one might slip in one's pocket. Stateliness of form implies
stateliness of content, and vice versa. Let a book be, for a generation,
of such good report that it may be said to have become a
classic, and a large-paper edition is justified. Let those who must
cavil do so. If they cannot rise above the utilitarian ideal, they
can easily obtain the work in a small format and be happy.</p>

<p>It may not be out of order to say at this point that, while a considerable
range in the size of books is not only permissible but
desirable, there are limits at both ends of the scale where practicability
ceases to exist and we pass into the realm of curiosities
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tours de force</i>. Thus the miniature book, for all its charm,
lies outside the confines of normal book-design. As to the maximum
size that may be legitimately allowed for a book, it should
never, I think, exceed the normal folio height (defined approximately
by the larger moulds employed for manufacturing hand-made
paper) while its bulk and weight should not preclude the
possibility of holding it by the spine with one hand while turning
the leaves with the other, when such a method of referring to
its contents may be necessary. And now a final word as to dimensions.
Large or small, the most perfect book will always be one
of which the thickness bears a just and agreeable relation to its
height and width. Small and slender books are delightful objects
which no one could wish to abolish (one cannot say as much
for the lamelliform folio, a veritable atrocity), but their inferiority
to books of a meet thickness becomes apparent when,
with (or, worse yet, without) their vertical, neck-twisting titles
they are placed on a shelf.</p>

<p>We must next turn our attention to those aspects of a book
which have to do with its plan and construction and which we
have called <em>tectonic</em>.</p>

<p>In its physical character a book addresses itself to two of our
senses, the sense of sight and the sense of touch. Because the tactile
qualities of a book are relatively of less importance than its visual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[Pg 119]</span>
aspects, let us first deal with those elements which are, in part at
least, evaluated through the sense of touch.</p>

<p>Our first impression of a book is received from its exterior, its
binding. Now the qualities to be looked for in the binding of a
book are: (1) the character and quality of the material, (2) suitability,
(3) soundness and charm of design, (4) agreeable color
(a relative term), (5) workmanship, (6) pleasantness to the
touch. Granting adequacy in all of these (and no book can pretend
to fineness without such adequacy), there is still another
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">desideratum</i> less easy to specify. It might be called (7) "the
evidence of durability." A book when taken in the hand should
have a feeling of compactness, almost of solidity. I do not mean
by this that it should feel like a block of wood, but it should,
when picked up, when opened, or when its hinges are tested, give
the impression that leaves and cover are so firmly (and honestly)
knit together that they constitute a unit, having in its "feel" the
evidence (or the assurance) of durability.</p>

<p>The next characteristic of a book to be noted through the
sense of touch is the <em>texture</em> of the paper. By "texture" several
things are meant: a surface agreeable to the hand, the degree of
crispness, an impression of toughness (again the evidence of durability),
and the degree of flexibility. Ideally, the paper in a
book should satisfy all these requirements and should possess as
well certain qualities of character, style, and color, pleasing to the
informed eye. These will be dealt with in their proper place.
The paper should be flexible, without the flimsiness characteristic
of papers weak in substance. It should bend readily when the
leaves are turned and should flow smoothly through the hand
when all the leaves are bent at once. Stiffness in the leaves of a
book (an all too common defect) is not, it should be observed,
always the fault of the paper. It is often due to the choice of a
paper too heavy for the size of the leaf. The same paper in a
larger leaf might have the desired flexibility.</p>

<p>The final tactile test of a fine book (applicable, alas, to very
few books indeed) resides in the character of the impression of
the type on the paper. In the best printing, the surface of the
page, if rubbed with the palm of the hand, shows a slight and
pleasant roughness due to the sinking of the type into the paper.
Such printing is rare in modern books because it is difficult of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[Pg 120]</span>
attainment with machines designed for quantity production. To
attain the effect described the paper should be dampened before
printing, and an ink employed that is adaptable only to the hand
press. Dry paper, particularly when heavily sized, resists a deep
impression. It can be <em>heavily</em> impressed, but there is not the same
difference between the impressed and unimpressed portions, due
to the impaction of the substance caused by the pressure of the
type, which results when dampened paper is used. In the latter
instance, the depth of impression is <em>within</em> the sheet, not an embossment
on the reverse side. This incisiveness, without a corresponding
relief on the back of the sheet, is shown when an
impression without ink is made on a hand press with dampened
paper and a hard packing.</p>

<p>In printing on dry paper it is necessary, if adequate color is to
be obtained, to use such a quantity of ink, of a consistency suitable
to machine-press printing, that a really deep (not merely
heavy) impression cannot be imparted to paper without "spreading,"
which slightly modifies the sharpness of the type. The machine
printer must choose therefore between a surfacy quality
with sharpness and a heavy (not necessarily deep) impression
with a loss of sharpness, neither of which is ideal. There are some
that will question the truth of this statement, calling attention to
specimens of machine printing on dry paper in which the ink has
been driven into the sheet and perfect sharpness maintained. It
may be said, however, in support of our contention, that, under
the test of hand and eye, this perfectly printed dry sheet will be
found, in the last analysis, to lack, in comparison with a sheet perfectly
printed by hand on dampened paper, a certain almost-indefinable
something that can perhaps be best described as a <em>living</em>
quality. This ultimate grace arises, I think, from the fact that in
competent hand-press printing the third dimension is not merely
suggested but actual; we have, in other words, not merely sharpness
but crispness; the effect attained is sculptural. No printing
that is lifeless, or to which such terms as "slick" and "dry" may
be appropriately applied can be called fine printing.</p>

<p>Turning now from the tactile to the visual elements of the fine
book, we shall consider, first of all, that fundamental factor of
all books, the text-page, upon the form or "layout" of which all
other typographic elements must, to a large extent, depend. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[Pg 121]</span>
text-page is of primary importance because by its rightness or
wrongness a book must stand or fall.</p>

<p>The elements of the text-page that call for consideration may
be grouped under three heads: first, <em>Form</em> (the proportions&mdash;width
to height&mdash;of the type-page and the balance of the rectangle
of type with the rectangle of paper); second, <em>Space</em> (the
ratio between the areas of the type-page and the paper-page);
third, <em>Tone</em> (the tonal value of the type mass and the relation
between its tone and the white area of the margins). In the perfect
text-page all these elements may be observed in nice adjustment,
severally and mutually.</p>

<p>There are those who contend that a proper relation of margins
to type-page may be arrived at by employing ratios identical
with those to be found in the well-proportioned pages of the
early printers. Others declare that correct margins can be created
by the application of an arithmetical or a geometrical formula.
It can be admitted that such procedures are, at least, <em>safe</em>;
that is to say, the danger of malproportioned margins will be
avoided. But neither the method nor the result can be ideal for
the simple reason that, while providing for the factors of form
and space, they fail to provide for the factor of tone. It should
be obvious that a rectangle of black type, with no space (leading)
between lines, and a rectangle of the same shape and size printed
from light-face type and generously leaded call for different margining.</p>

<p>All of this may seem to be supervacaneous, but the stubborn
fact remains that no one of the factors set forth above can be
ignored. It is perfectly true that the accomplished book designer
will compass the desired end through a sagacious application of
his knowledge and taste, but we are concerned here with presenting
the elements of the ideal book and it is therefore essential
that <em>all</em> the elements, no matter how much the initiated may take
some of them for granted, should be, for the benefit of the layman,
categorically enumerated.</p>

<p>It is necessary at this point to allude to the dictum&mdash;voiced in
high places as well as in low&mdash;that a book is primarily something
to be read; that every factor which does not contribute to that
end is an impertinence. The worthy champions of this faith
would be on firmer ground if they heaped their condemnation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[Pg 122]</span>
upon such adjuncts of a book as actually <em>lessen</em> its readability.
M. Paul Valéry has disposed of the matter so effectively from the
aesthetic point of view in his essay, <cite>Les deux vertus d'un livre</cite>,
that nothing remains to be said on that side of the question. But
there are other objections to be raised to this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipse dixit</i> of the
mechanists. Their contention that what we all grant is at once the
basic and paramount function of a book, its readability, is its only
function would, if carried to its logical conclusion, lead to a doctrine
in book design equivalent to what is known in present-day
architecture as "functionalism." Since functionalism or, as it is
sometimes called, the "machine and function" principle, demands
that the design of a building must grow out of and be restricted by
its predetermined use or purpose, it should follow that, if the sole
purpose of a book is that it be something to read, there is no
reason, based upon utility, for not using the whole area of the
paper-page, with margins of no more, let us say, than a quarter
of an inch or so. The uncomely, marginless illustrations of certain
recent books represent an application of this principle. If the protagonists
of the utilitarian ideal admit that margins are other than
a waste of usable space, they make a concession to the aesthetic
conception of a book, for the determination of margins, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mise
en page</i>, is primarily an element of design. It will be argued no
doubt, in contravention of this statement, that margins make for
ease of reading (utility), but that this is an untenable defensive
assumption should be proved by the perfect readability of newspaper
columns separated only by a light rule, or by the two-column
book or magazine page with only a pica of white between
the columns. Since it cannot be denied that the margins of a book,
if well proportioned, promote pleasure, an aesthetic function, the
true functionalist should, to be consistent, insist upon doing away
with them.</p>

<p>We may turn now from that major fundamental of the fine
book&mdash;a text-page of perfect seemliness&mdash;to a consideration of
other elements. But before doing so, it may be proper to explain
what some of my readers may deem an omission. I have said
nothing about the choice of type. It is axiomatic that good letter
is a prime essential of the good book. There are only two kinds of
type, good and bad. Good types, whether based upon classical
models or the quasi-original forms of contemporary type-designers,
are sufficiently numerous to make a suitable selection, pro<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[Pg 123]</span>vided
the printer knows anything whatever about the subject,
quite simple. It should be pointed out, however, that, other things
being equal, type cast from matrices struck from hand-cut
punches is superior to machine-cut type. This superiority is a
matter of real importance, chiefly in printing by means of the
hand press. Only in such printing is the difference between the
hand-cut and machine-cut letter fully apparent.</p>

<p>No type is good if some of the characters are marked by eccentricity.
Unorthodox peculiarities in the forms of certain letters
sometimes lend charm to a type-face, but there is a difference
between a peculiarity of shape thoughtfully and discreetly arrived
at and freakish variations which do not justify themselves
and bespeak only a stupid desire for novelty at any cost.</p>

<p>Given the seemly text-page as the prime requisite of the fine
book, our next consideration should be what may be called
<em>integration of the parts</em>. Here we must again think in terms of
architecture, with which art book-design has so much in common.
Let the parts of a book be few or many, simple or complex, it
is of the first importance that they be, one to the other and each
to all, harmoniously correlated.</p>

<p>In the simple undecorated and unillustrated book it is not only
desirable that sunken pages, if any (the first pages of chapters
or sections, for example), should show an equal sinkage. But all
isolated typographic elements, such as half-titles, elements of the
title page, copyright notice, dedication, headings of preliminary
and supplementary matter, etc., should fall on levels which,
though not necessarily identical, bear a mensural, not an arbitrary,
relation one to the other and to the structure of the book as a
whole. This requires, perhaps, some elucidation. Suppose we give
the first pages of our chapters a uniform sinkage. These pages,
let us say, establish three levels for us&mdash;(1) the chapter heading,
(2) chapter title, and (3) the first line of text. If we adopt the
same sinkage for Contents, Illustrations, Appendices, and Index,
putting the headings of this group on the same level as the chapter
headings (L<small>EVEL</small> 1), the first text lines of this group should be
on the same level as the chapter titles (L<small>EVEL</small> 2), or on the level
of the first text lines of the chapters (L<small>EVEL</small> 3). If, on the other
hand, we adopt a different sinkage (smaller) for the second group,
we may still relate it mensurally to the first group by placing the
first text lines of Group 2 on the same level as the chapter headings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[Pg 124]</span>
of Group 1. Suppose further that we place our half-titles on one of
the three or four levels that have been established. We still have
to deal with a copyright notice, perhaps a limit notice, a bibliographical
note, and a dedication. It is not essential that all of these
should fall on the same level, but it <em>is</em> essential that each be <em>related
to some one of the established levels</em>. Finally, it is desirable that
such major elements of the title page as a subtitle or the author's
name should be placed on one of the established levels.</p>

<p>An observance of this principle makes for homogeneity of
design. In reading a book so put together we are spared (without
knowing that we are spared) the disturbance of our sense of
balance which results, almost without our knowing it, when our
eyes fall upon a page some part of which is not "tied in" architecturally
with the rest of the book. The effect is similar to that
of a many-paneled room with an impost cornice at a certain
height in all the panels except two or three where it is either
higher or lower. We have, in one case, faulty architecture; in the
other, faulty book-making. In judging a book or a building, it
should be borne in mind that, however charming its parts, it must
be regarded as a whole. If our contemplation of it is to be attended
with pleasure and comfort, its parts must be so disposed, so correlated,
that they will not produce a "jumpy" effect.</p>

<p>It is not contended that every book in which this refinement
of perfectly integrated parts has been ignored should be considered
a failure because it is less than perfect. If that were true,
few books would pass the test. It would indeed be hypercritical
to insist that a failure to observe this principle actually spoils an
otherwise well-made book. It is desirable, however, that the principle
should be observed <em>as far as the material will permit</em>. It must
be recognized, also, that sometimes the elements are so diverse&mdash;chapter
headings or the internal titles of essays, short stories or
poems&mdash;that a strict adherence to the principle becomes impossible.
In such instances, the designer's task is still to strive for
order and integration. Perfect order, symmetry, and balance may
be unattainable, but this does not justify him in being haphazard.
When order is observed we may not be conscious of it; when it
is not observed we are aware of its absence. Movement is of the
highest importance as a factor of design&mdash;such movement, for
example, as is imparted to a book by this very diversity of its
elements&mdash;but good design demands movement that is ordered,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[Pg 125]</span>
not arbitrary. If liberties are taken (and it is desirable, in the
interest of vitality and charm, that they should be taken) they
must justify themselves aesthetically; they should not only please
us in themselves but as evidence of the designer's intelligence, his
insight, subtlety, sensitiveness, discrimination, and tact. However
diverse the elements or parts of a book may be, however they
may, by reason of such diversity, render perfect order and balance
impossible, their arrangement should at least possess a
<em>rationale</em>.</p>

<p>This need of a fundamental balance has its basis in its pleasure-giving
value. I have adverted to the analogy between book-design
and architecture, let me point now to an equally pertinent analogy
with the structure of poetry. "Verse," says Poe, "originates
in the human enjoyment of equality, fitness. To this enjoyment,
also, all the moods of verse&mdash;rhythm, meter, stanza, rhyme, alliteration,
the refrain, and other analogous effects&mdash;are to be referred."
Specifically, the parts of a book&mdash;half-titles, headings, etc., etc.&mdash;should
be, severally <em>and collectively</em>, related as are such structural
elements in verse as recurrent rhythms, rhymes, and refrains.</p>

<p>We must now consider the decorated or illustrated book. In
the first place, it should be understood that no form of decoration
or illustration is legitimate in the strictly fine book except such
as are printed from wood or metal engraved by hand, preferably
in relief which comports with type both in physical character and
in the means by which the image is imparted to the paper. Process-engravings
are disqualified not only because of the preponderant
mechanical factor, but because mechanical engraving in relief
cannot produce a line of the delicacy and purity obtained with
the engraving tool. As a corollary to the principle of integration
set forth above let us take first the type of decorated book to
which most obviously it applies. A book carrying on various pages
head-bands of varying depth and varying tone&mdash;deep, shallow,
black and heavy, light and delicate&mdash;will produce a disturbing
effect. Less obvious but hardly less disturbing is a succession of
initial letters differing in size, in tone, or in position on the page.
The book with initial letters strewn through the text, sometimes
several on a single page, is a challenge to the designer. When thus
arbitrarily employed it is important, in order that the initials shall
not be obtrusive, that they be so selected as to size (in proportion
to the page) and so integrated with the book as a whole that their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[Pg 126]</span>
"accidental" character is either disguised or lost and their recurrence
actually contributes to the unity of the volume by virtue
of their consistent accentual value.</p>

<p>An arbitrary arrangement of tailpieces is likely to produce a
"jumpy" effect. Since the spaces (at the ends of chapters or sections)
within which tailpieces may be placed differ in area, such
decorative elements cannot always fall on the same level. This
irregularity can be compensated for in a measure by adjusting
the size of the decoration to the area of the space it occupies. By
what may seem to be a negation of the law of balance here
insisted upon, such a variation is more productive of architectural
harmony than tailpieces of uniform size would be if disposed in
spaces of varying area.</p>

<p>Returning for a moment to the undecorated book, it may be
remarked in passing that verse, particularly a collection of short
lyrics, does not lend itself to good book-design. It should be
enough to point out that the disproportion between type mass
and white paper caused by short measure and the frequently
meager letter-press deprive books of verse of the book's basic
structural factor, the rectangle of type. How decoration can be
employed to overcome this deficiency is perfectly exemplified in
the original edition of Dorat's <cite>Les Baisers</cite>.</p>

<p>With the principles of balance and unity still in mind, it will
hardly, I think, admit of contradiction that the scattering of odd-sized
illustrations through the text is incompatible with both of
these principles. Such illustrations, particularly those of irregular
shape bounded on two or three sides by type, are as destructive
of balance and unity as is poor fenestration in a building. It is not
enough that something like a balance is effected on facing pages
(an elementary principle in layout); the lack of a complete integration
of the pictures with the book and the disturbance
created by distorting the letter-press into odd shapes preclude the
possibility of such a book being regarded as well-planned, much
less ideal, however charming it may be in detail.</p>

<p>We have seen, while considering the major aspects of book-design,
in what wise paper must be judged with regard to those
first or immediate impressions gained from seeing and feeling it.
I must now carry the consideration of paper a little farther. Since
style and character are essential qualities of the fine book, we must
insist upon these qualities in every element of its substance. Now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[Pg 127]</span>
style and character at their utmost are peculiar (for reasons that
have to do with the methods of manufacture) to hand-made
paper only, laid or wove, and, it may be further insisted, to only
the best hand-made paper. Desirable as wove paper is for certain
purposes, it cannot be denied that it has less character than the
laid sheet. It is also true that no feature of fine laid paper gives
more character to a sheet than the so-called "antique" factor, a
slight thickening of the pulp and greater opacity along the chain-lines.
By an "improved" method of mould-making, introduced by
Baskerville, this thickening was eliminated, but, whatever mechanical
superiority its absence may represent, there can be no
question but that it represents a loss of character. All book papers
produced by machinery (particularly the laids in which the effect
of laid lines is mechanically faked) are as much imitations of and
substitutes for hand-made paper as machine-made lace is a substitute
for hand-made lace, and the disparity in quality is as
great. We speak of "imitation lace" and "real lace," meaning
machine-made and hand-made; we might, with equal propriety,
speak of "imitation paper" and "real paper." Ideally, then, the
fine book, in the fullest and strictest sense of the term, can be
printed on no other than paper that is hand-made and of the best
quality.</p>

<p>As to the color of paper for fine books, the whole question may
be considerably clarified at once by the statement that everything
suggestive of artificiality should be avoided. A paper that is
chalky white or bluish white tells us at once that the rags which
went into its manufacture were chemically (that is to say, artificially)
bleached. A great many toned papers, described as
"cream" or "india," are artificially colored and show it. The most
desirable tone for fine book paper is the "natural" tone of unbleached
(and sorted as such) linen rags. Its slight creamish color
is at once pleasant to the eye and holds the promise of that agreeable
mellowness which comes, very slowly, with age. A number
of very pleasant books have been printed in recent years on gray,
blue, green, and brownish papers (the last usually a deliberate
simulation of ancient paper), but, despite their charm, they are,
I think, open to the charge of affectation, against which, if true,
there is of course no defense. If not actually "arty," they come
perilously near to it.</p>

<p>It has not been my purpose in this paper to lay down the rules<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[Pg 128]</span>
for making a fine book, for, after all, rules are of no use whatever
(in an art or in a craft) except to be broken&mdash;wisely. Neither has
any attempt been made, since this is not a technical treatise, to
outline the methods by which the results described may be produced.
I have tried merely to set forth the various criteria by
which fine books should be judged and the principles (quite
different from rules) that underlie them. If the "specifications"
seem over-exacting, if they are to be dismissed as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trop raffinés</i>, I
must ask the caviler if that which purports to be "fine" can be
"too refined"? Let those who wish to compromise (with popular
taste, with outlay and returns, with honesty, with self-respect,
or with machinery) do so, but unless the thing they produce
represents, with eloquence and beauty, the full and unconditional
employment of <em>every realizable aid to betterment, physical and
technical</em>, it is something other than a fine book of the first order.
We must discourage ourselves in order that we may be strong.</p>

<p>It may be said in introduction that the Society's Investigation into the
Physical Properties of Books was undertaken by a special committee
whose personnel insured that its consideration would be
thorough and unbiased.</p>

<p>The Committee began its labour by an examination of all
books published in America since the year 1910. This examination
forced upon the investigators the conclusion that "All Books
of the present day are Badly Made." The conclusion was unanimous.</p>

<p>Working out from this basic fact in an effort to arrive at the
reasons underlying the evil, the Committee held numerous sittings
in consultation with men concerned with various branches
of printing and publishing. From these sittings there developed
a mass of information of an unusual and stimulating character.</p>

<p>The publishers have chosen from the Record of the examination
a few examples, not because they are extraordinary but
because they present typical points of view. They are transcribed
verbatim. It will be obvious that in certain cases it has been no
more than courteous to suppress the names of the persons assisting
the investigation. For the sake of uniformity it has been
deemed wise to follow this practice throughout.</p>


<p class="p1 center">I. M<small>R.</small> B.</p>

<p>Q: Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, will you please tell the committee why you printed
this book on card-board?</p>

<p>A: To make it the right thickness. It had to be one inch thick.</p>

<p>&mdash;Why that thick, particularly?</p>

<p>&mdash;Because otherwise it would not sell. If a book isn't one inch
thick it won't sell.</p>

<p>&mdash;Do you mean to say that people who buy books select them
with the help of a foot rule?</p>

<p>&mdash;They have to have some standard of selection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>&mdash;So that it is your practice to stretch out the text if it is too
short by printing it on egg-box stock?</p>

<p>&mdash;Not my practice, particularly. All publishers do it. We are
obliged to use this and other means to bring the book up to a
proper thickness. You must remember that our prices are not
based on the contents of a book but on its size.</p>

in the physical properties of books published since 1910.</p>


<p>&mdash;You mention other methods. Would you mind telling us
what other method you use?</p>

<p>&mdash;We can expand the letter-press judiciously. We limit the
matter to seven words on a page, say, and so get a greater number
of pages. We can use large type and can lead considerably.</p>

<p>&mdash;But does not that practice hurt the appearance of the page?
Make a poor-looking page?</p>

<p>&mdash;I am afraid I do not get your meaning.</p>

<p>&mdash;I mean to say, is not the page ugly and illegible when you
expand the matter to that extent?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>&mdash;You don't consider the look of a page in making a book. That
is a thing that doesn't enter into the production of a book. If I
understand you correctly, do you mean to say that it matters how
a book looks?</p>

<p>&mdash;That was the thought in my mind.</p>

<p>&mdash;That's a new idea in book publishing!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&mdash;You were speaking of the pressure of industrial conditions
since the war. Under these conditions what percentage of the
traditions of the craft can you preserve, would you say?</p>

<p>&mdash;The traditions of what craft?</p>

<p>&mdash;The craft of printing, obviously. What I am trying to get at
is this:&mdash;There are certain precise and matured standards of workmanship
in the printing craft; these standards are the results of
experiment through nearly five hundred years. How far are these
standards effective under your present-day conditions?</p>

<p>&mdash;Those standards, so far as I know anything about them, are
what you would call academic. In the first place, book-manufacturing
is not a craft, it is a business. As for standards of
workmanship&mdash;I can understand the term in connection with
cabinet-making, for example, or tailoring, but I should not apply
the expression to books. You do not talk about the "standards
of workmanship" in making soap, do you?</p>

<p>&mdash;Then in your mind there does not linger any atmosphere of
an art about the making of books?</p>

<p>&mdash;When you talk about "atmosphere" you have me out of my
depth. There isn't any atmosphere of art lingering about making
soap, is there?</p>

<p>&mdash;You would class soap-making with book-making?</p>

<p>&mdash;I can see no reason why not.</p>

<p>&mdash;May I ask you why you were selected by &mdash;&mdash; Company to
manage their manufacturing department?</p>

<p>&mdash;Really, I must say that you overstep the borders&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;Please do not misinterpret my question. It is really pertinent
to the inquiry.</p>

<p>&mdash;It should certainly be obvious why a man is chosen for a given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[Pg 133]</span>
position. I am employed to earn a satisfactory return on the shareholders'
investment. Is that the information you want?</p>

<p>&mdash;I think that is what we want. Would you then consider yourself
as happily employed in making soap as in making books?</p>

<p>&mdash;Quite as well employed, if making soap paid the dividend.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&mdash;While we are on this subject, may I ask you how you choose
the artists who make your illustrations?</p>

<p>&mdash;My practice is to select an illustrator whose name is well
known.</p>

<p>&mdash;Is that the only point you consider?</p>

<p>&mdash;I should say, yes. I am not aware of any other reason for
spending money on this feature. It is always an uncertain detail
and this way of making a choice puts the matter on a safe basis.</p>

<p>&mdash;It is sometimes assumed that the illustrations should have a
sympathetic bearing on the story. Does not that consideration
have some weight with you in choosing your artist?</p>

<p>&mdash;None, I should say. You see, the pictures are not really a
necessary part of the book. They are a kind of frill that the public
has got in the way of expecting, and we have to put them in.
Illustrations as a rule stand us as a dead loss unless they are made
by a well-known artist. Then, of course, they help sell the book.</p>


<p class="p1 center">II. M<small>R.</small> M<small>C</small>G.</p>

<p>A: The gentlemen of the committee must remember that the
book-publishing business is a gamble. Each new issue, particularly
in the department of fiction, is a highly adventurous risk. Our
percentage of blanks would astonish you if we dared to state it.
But any book may turn out a best-seller. This hope keeps us going.
It is absolutely a gamble, as I say. You can see that under
these conditions we cannot spend very much money on non-essentials.
We have to strip the books down to the barest necessities.</p>

<p>Personally I should like to see the firm put out nothing that is
not well designed and well printed. But as an agent of the firm I
have to set aside my personal preferences. The directors are very
much down on what they call art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>&mdash;Has the firm ever looked into the question of good workmanship
as a possible aid to sales?</p>

<p>&mdash;Not under the present management. The founder looked at
good work as more or less a marketing advantage.</p>

<p>&mdash;What do you think caused the present management to
change from that opinion?</p>

<p>&mdash;They haven't changed. They never had it. They get at the
matter from another angle altogether. Their policy is to reduce
the production cost to the minimum. The minimum in theory
would be reached when the public complained. The public hasn't
complained, so you can't tell when to stop cheapening.</p>

<p>You see the directors don't look at a book as a fabricated thing
at all. Books are merely something to sell&mdash;merchandise. Our
management&mdash;and all the rest of them, for that matter&mdash;come
from the selling side of the business and do not have any pride in
the product. Old Mr. &mdash;&mdash; was a publisher because he liked
books. That made an entirely different policy in the old firm, of
course.</p>

<p>&mdash;To get back to the question of good workmanship helping
sales:&mdash;Here are two books published abroad to be sold at 50 cents
and 80 cents. They can very well be called works of art. Do you
not think that these well designed paper covers would stand out
among other books and invite customers to themselves?</p>

<p>&mdash;Undoubtedly they would.</p>

<p>&mdash;Have you ever tried the experiment of putting out editions in
paper covers of attractive design?</p>

<p>&mdash;Never. It couldn't be done. People wouldn't buy them.</p>

<p>&mdash;But you said a moment ago&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;Moreover the difference of cost between cheap cloth
sides and paper covers of the kind you have there is so slight that
it wouldn't pay to try the experiment. People want stiff board
covers. It doesn't much matter what is inside, but they insist on
board covers.</p>

<p>&mdash;How do you arrive at that fact?</p>

<p>&mdash;Through our salesmen.</p>

<p>&mdash;And you say that paper covers have never been tried?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>&mdash;Never. None of our travellers would go out on the road with
a sample in paper covers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&mdash;A little while ago you said something about your salesmen
helping you to an understanding of the public taste. I infer that
you get considerable help from this source?</p>

<p>&mdash;Most valuable help indeed. We depend entirely on the reports
the sales force turns in in these matters. The salesmen are in
direct contact with the retailers and are naturally in a position to
feel the public pulse, so to speak. Their help is invaluable. They
can anticipate the demand very often.</p>

<p>I had reference more particularly to the way books are made.</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh, on that point too. We never make a final decision on a
cover design, for instance, without showing it to the salesmen.
They very often make valuable suggestions as to changes of
colour, etc. They run largely to red.</p>

<p>&mdash;It would seem, then, that the designing of the books is very
much in the hands of the salesmen?</p>

<p>&mdash;Quite in their hands.</p>

<p>&mdash;Are the office-boys often called into consultation?</p>

<p>&mdash;Mr. &mdash;&mdash; finds his stenographer a very great help in passing
upon certain points&mdash;illustrations, etc.</p>

<p>&mdash;Does it appear to you that the sales department would be the
one best qualified to pass on points of design?</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, there, you see&mdash;the books have to be sold&mdash;that is what
we make them for&mdash;and the sales department is the one in closest
touch with the people that buy the books&mdash;that knows just what
they want.</p>

<p>&mdash;The standards of quality, then, are set by the people who buy
the books?</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh, absolutely so. How else would you move the books? It
is a merchandising proposition, you must remember.</p>

<p>&mdash;But do you not think that people would buy decently made
books as willingly as poorly made books?</p>

<p>At the same price, yes. No question about it. The book-buying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[Pg 136]</span>
public doesn't worry its head about the way books are made. It
doesn't know anything about it. And well made books cost more.
The trade is committed to a dollar-and-a-half article and can't risk
going above it.</p>

<p>&mdash;Your opinion is that the price of a well made book would be
so high as to prevent its sale?</p>

<p>&mdash;In the case of fiction, yes. The price has become almost a
fixture.</p>

<p>&mdash;We shall have to go outside of fiction, then, to look for well
made books?</p>

<p>&mdash;It amounts to that.</p>

<p>&mdash;You have said that certain unproductive factors prevent you
from spending what you otherwise might on good workmanship.
What specific factors would you mention?</p>

<p>&mdash;Plates&mdash;electros. We plate everything on the chance of its
running into several printings. 80 per cent of the books are not
reprinted. You can see that the money tied up in plates is a very
considerable sum, and, as I say, 80 per cent of it is dead loss. We
are obliged to take the chance, however.</p>

<p>&mdash;Has any remedy occurred to you?</p>

<p>&mdash;If stereotyping could be revived as an accurate process it
might help us out. It would cost much less to make and to store
paper matrices than to make electrotypes. The difficulty here is
that no one knows how to make good stereotypes, and the stereotype
plates at their best are more trouble to make ready. Trouble
with the press-room, you see.</p>

<p>&mdash;Is it possible under good conditions to get satisfactory results
from stereotype plates?</p>

<p>&mdash;Unquestionably. The books printed from this kind of plates
in the first days of the invention are entirely satisfactory.</p>


<p class="p1 center">III. M<small>R.</small> L.</p>

<p>Q. Can a trade-edition book be well made and sell for $1.50?</p>

<p>&mdash;That depends on how high you set your standard.</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, let us not be too rigorous. Can it be made better, say,
than this book?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>&mdash;Beyond question. It will all depend upon whether or not the
printer has a few lingering memories of the standards of printing.</p>

<p>&mdash;But should not the setting of standards come from the publisher?</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh yes, under ideal conditions. Both printer and publisher
should have a hand in it.</p>

<p>&mdash;How would you make a book of fiction to be sold for $1.50?</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, such a book could have a good title-page as cheaply as
a bad one&mdash;and the whole typographic scheme would cost no
more if it were logically done instead of crudely strung together.
By logically done I mean with well proportioned, practicable
margins and legible headings, etc. The press-work on books is
reasonably good but the "layout" or design is entirely neglected.
It calls for a little planning, of course, but no more than should
be available in any reputable plant. It isn't so much that these
books are badly planned as it is that they are not planned at all.</p>

<p>&mdash;But most printing firms have a planning department, do they
not?</p>

<p>&mdash;The planning in most presses is concerned with the handling
of material, not with the <em>designing</em> of material. This is no doubt
due to the fact that the Taylor System has not yet got around to
Aesthetic Efficiency.</p>

<p>&mdash;Are not the typographical unions concerned to train their
men on these points of design that you mention?</p>

<p>&mdash;The unions have only one idea&mdash;and it is not concerned with
the improvement of printing.</p>

<p>&mdash;Are there any trade schools that teach these things? Are not
the employers' associations promoting schools to train men in
the craft?</p>

<p>&mdash;The employers' associations have one idea&mdash;a little different
from the idea of the unions, perhaps, but not concerned with the
improvement of printing. There are trade schools but they teach
only the mechanics of the craft.</p>

<p>&mdash;Apparently, then, there is no place in this country where one
can learn how to design printing?</p>

<p>&mdash;You can safely say that there is no such place.</p>

<p class="p1 center">IV. M<small>R.</small> A.</p>

<p>Q: What is your own opinion on the subject of illustrations in
books?</p>

<p>&mdash;In what particular do you mean?</p>

<p>&mdash;I mean, do you think that illustrations help or hinder the
quality of a book?</p>

<p>&mdash;The question is too general to be answered easily. May I ask
you to be more specific?</p>

<p>&mdash;For example, here is a "best-seller" with several&mdash;five or six&mdash;half-tone
illustrations. Do you consider that these pictures make
the book a more complete thing as a specimen of book-making?</p>

<p>&mdash;Most certainly not.</p>

<p>&mdash;Then would you say that illustrations in such books were a
detraction?</p>

<p>&mdash;Illustrations such as these, yes. Though it would be hard to
detract from this particular book.</p>

<p>&mdash;It is a standard book&mdash;a standard type of book.</p>

<p>&mdash;I fear that it is.</p>

<p>&mdash;What kind of illustrations would you favour?</p>

<p>&mdash;For many books, none at all. In these books of current fiction
the pictures are either futile or else detrimental to the development
of the plot. They give the game away, so to speak, when the
author may wish to hold the story in suspense. The effort to avoid
this disaster accounts for the multitude of undramatic pictures
you see in books.</p>

<p>&mdash;Your theory of no pictures should appeal to the publishers
but I doubt if the illustrators will stand with you.</p>

<p>&mdash;Illustration is a trade as well as an art.</p>

<p>&mdash;True. But we are trying to limit the inquiry to the artistic side
at present. When, then, according to your deductions, would illustrations
be called for?</p>

<p>&mdash;When they can make a stage-setting for the story. When
they ornament it or suggest it, perhaps, instead of reveal it. Impressions
and "atmosphere" instead of literal diagrams with a
cross marking the spot where, etc.</p>

<p>&mdash;But perhaps people like the cross marking the spot where.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>&mdash;We are limiting the discussion to the artistic side, are we not?</p>

<p>&mdash;What about the half-tone process of engraving?</p>

<p>&mdash;The process is a way of doing a thing that cannot be done
cheaply by any other means.</p>

<p>&mdash;Do you consider it a process that adds to the artistic possibilities
of book printing?</p>

<p>&mdash;You mean according to the standards that prevailed in the
earlier days of the craft?</p>

<p>&mdash;I do. Yes.</p>

<p>&mdash;According to those standards it seems to me that half-tones
will always have to be considered as necessities forced upon the
book-printer. They demand a kind of paper that is never a satisfactory
book-paper. In the case of the kind of books we are talking
about the relief line methods have always given the most
artistic results, because they are so closely related to the character
of type.</p>

<p>One regrets, however, to give up the chances for tonal designs
that the half-tone process provides. Probably the designers and
printers will work out a satisfactory relation between half-tones
and type when the craze for photographic detail passes a little.
As things stand, I should say that the best results are to be had
with uncoated book-papers and with line plates. It is true books
are rarely illustrated this way&mdash;current fiction, I mean&mdash;but the
method might be used to produce a very attractive and unusual
result.</p>

<p>&mdash;Then you would condemn the use of half-tones in this kind
of book?</p>

<p>&mdash;If you mean the usual kind of half-tones printed separately
and inserted, I do. But if you are making a book of travel, for
example, the half-tones from photographs explain and justify
themselves.</p>

<p>But on this whole subject of book illustration it strikes me that
if you are to make the design from the start you might as well
make it in harmony with the kind of paper and printing you are
planning to use, and get all the artistic advantage of fitting your
means to your limitations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[Pg 140]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Are you familiar with the Christy-Holbein Test?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes. That is to say, I have heard of your applying it, and remember
that the percentages were very much against Holbein.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ninety-three to seven, on an average. How do you explain
such a crudity of taste in these groups of people otherwise well educated?</p>

<p>&mdash;By the deduction that they are not educated. That is to say
that these people, cultivated in other ways, react precisely like
savages when confronted with pictures or drawings. They "go
for" the tinsel and glitter and are opaque to the higher and more
civilized values. They get the most pleasure from drawings that
they think they could make themselves. This is the basis of the
Eight-year-old Formula widely applied in the department of
newspaper comics: "Make your drawing so that it can be understood
by a child eight years old."</p>

<p>All of this is clearly lack of training, because their taste is good
in other matters&mdash;music, for example, and house furnishings.</p>

<p>&mdash;You would deduce, then, that the periodical and book-publishing
industry has failed to train the taste of its public in such
matters?</p>

<p>&mdash;It has done worse: it has depraved that taste. Because there
was, not very long ago, a fine tradition in this country in the line
of illustration.</p>

<p>&mdash;Why should the publishers find any advantage in depraving
the taste of the public&mdash;as you say they have done?</p>

<p>&mdash;Because they turned their backs on the standards of the publishing
business and became merchandisers solely. They had to
sell the goods and they had to "sell" a big new public. The quickest
way to this public&mdash;through flash-and-crash tactics&mdash;they
adopted. And naturally ran themselves and the public down hill.</p>

<p>&mdash;May there not be other sides to it, too? May it not be that the
art schools are not now producing draughtsmen of a calibre to
support the fine tradition you mention?</p>

<p>&mdash;That may have something to do with it. But even that is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[Pg 141]</span>
mixed up with the other. I think that the chief difficulty is with
the publishers.</p>

<p>&mdash;And the public?</p>

<p>&mdash;The public will follow if the publishers lead.</p>


<p class="p1 center">V. M<small>R.</small> S.</p>

<p>A. Are you not making the mistake of keeping too close to the
publishers? It seems to me that you will not get at all the facts
behind the situation until you get in touch with the people we
sell the books to. <em>They</em> are the factors that bring about the conditions
you object to. The publisher is merely a machine for selling
the public what it wants.</p>

<p>&mdash;Then the publisher has no selective function?</p>

<p>&mdash;Absolutely none.</p>

<p>&mdash;How does the public bring about the condition we object to?</p>

<p>&mdash;Obviously by buying the books.</p>

<p>&mdash;I mean to say, how does the public prevail upon you to sell
it trashy books instead of well made books?</p>

<p>&mdash;The public is entirely uneducated on the subject of books,
in your sense. People know nothing at all about paper or printing
or pictures or things of that sort. One book is as good as another
to any educated man so long as he can read it. He doesn't know
that there is any such thing as good printing or bad printing or
good or bad taste in making books. Under these conditions we
should be fools to spend money on features that do not have any
bearing on sales. It's a simple business proposition.</p>

<p>&mdash;Would the public that you are discussing buy well made
books as willingly as trashy books?</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh, absolutely. It's the books they are interested in&mdash;what
they contain, not how they are made. They wouldn't know the
difference.</p>


<p class="p1 center">VI. M<small>R.</small> G.</p>

<p>A: What's the use of talking about standards in connection with
things like these? These are not books. They aren't fit to wad a
gun with. I wouldn't have them in the house. Nobody pays any
attention to stuff like that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>There isn't what you would call a book on the table, except
this one, perhaps. That's printed in England and sent over in
sheets and bound on this side. But that one is set in a bastard
Caslon. It isn't the original Caslon but a revision with the
descenders cut off. See how he's got his O upside down!</p>

<p>Those others&mdash;what's the use of talking about them at all? It
reminds me of the story about the Chinaman&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;But, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, do you not think it possible to get up this
class of books in a manner that would suit you better?</p>

<p>&mdash;You can't hope to get anything like a decent book until you
do away with the damnable cheap paper and the vile types. And
then you will have to start in and teach the printer how to print.
There aren't more than a half a dozen presses in the country that
know how to print. Most printing looks like it had been done
with apple-butter on a hay-press&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;What you say is unhappily true. What we are trying to find
out are the causes of this state of things.</p>

<p>&mdash;The causes are everywhere&mdash;all through the rattletrap, cheap-jack,
shoddy work that is being done in every kind of trade. Nobody
cares for making decent things any more.</p>

<p>The only cure is to get back to decent standards of workmanship
in everything again. But the case seems to me to be hopeless.
I try to do printing up to a decent standard&mdash;and that is about all
any of us can do. I don't believe you can hope to do much good
through your societies and investigations. I believe in each one
doing his own job in the best way he knows how. That's the only
way you can raise the standard. It's the work you turn out that
counts.</p>


<p class="p2 center">A<small>N</small> A<small>BSTRACT OF THE</small> C<small>OMMITTEE'S</small> R<small>ECOMMENDATIONS</small></p>

<p>Two main questions resulting from the Inquiry present themselves
to the Committee. The first question is: Is it within the
power of the Society of Calligraphers, of any society, or of Society
itself, to restore to the printing of books a standard of good work?
The second and major question: Are books necessary to the
present social state?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>I.  When the Committee began its work it assumed as a matter
of course that the established standards of printing would serve it
as guide-posts and criteria. It expected to traverse a country where
the highways were in need of repair, perhaps, and the marks of
direction dim, but on the whole a negotiable country. It found
a very different state of things.</p>

<p>Instead of roads to be followed with some excusable discomfort
it found not even trails. Such highways as had once been
charted were obliterated. Not only hair-lines but the most elementary
blazemarks were overgrown and lost beyond any hope
of recovery. Instead of following the planned course of visit and
consultation the Committee was forced to reorganize itself into
an expedition of discovery. It has been fortunate to return at all.</p>

<p>The collected data of the exploration can lead to but one conclusion:
That the whole fabric of Standards of Workmanship
will have to be rebuilt from the beginning. Whether this can be
done under the present state of society is a matter to be discussed
in connection with the second question.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>II. Are books necessary to the present social state? The Committee's
finding is, unanimously and conclusively, No.</p>

<p>During the past twenty years many influences have been at
work to wean mankind from the use of books. Automobiles, the
motion-picture drama, professional athletics, the <cite>Saturday Evening
Post</cite>&mdash;these operated even before the Great War to discourage
the habit of reading. Since the war the progress of society&mdash;culminating,
in America, in the dictatorship of the proletariat&mdash;has
effectually completed the process. Books as an element vital
to the welfare of the race have been eliminated.</p>

<p>The Society of Calligraphers is thus freed at one stroke from
the obligations implied in the first question. But there are still
books in existence, and for these the Committee feels a professional
concern. For the Investigation, if it has done nothing else,
has disclosed the most cogent and ineluctable fact: that wherever
there is contact between books and the public, the effect upon
the books is deleterious.</p>

<p>So far as the immediate situation is concerned, the public, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span>
discontinuing the contact, has obviated the danger. But in a
period of revolution no condition can be taken for granted as
fixed. It is quite within the range of possibility that the public,
under compulsion, may turn again to books and reading; and
this, the Committee believes, is a contingency the Society should
be prepared to meet.</p>

<p>Publishers as a group promise, for the immediate future, to be
a harassed and unimpressionable body. Influence upon them can
be brought to bear only through public demand. Should a public
demand for books revive, it will be imperative for the Society
either to quench it altogether&mdash;a project which the Committee
has discarded as visionary&mdash;or to take it in hand at its inception
and give it constructive shape by forcing upon public attention
such knowledge of the more elementary points of good taste as
shall make impossible the further prostitution of standards. As
the most direct means to this end it is urgently recommended by
the Committee that the Society take up at once the study of
advertising.</p>

<p>Q: Twenty years ago you were kind enough to discuss book-manufacturing
with us.</p>

<p>&mdash;Twenty years. Remarkable memory!</p>

<p>&mdash;It meant a great deal to us&mdash;your help. It was in 1919. We
were conducting an inquiry&mdash;perhaps you remember&mdash;into the
physical qualities of books.</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh, yes! How you could improve them, and so on. Yes.</p>

<p>&mdash;Now we are back again&mdash;to see what you think now.</p>

<p>&mdash;Good. Interesting idea. Ask me questions.</p>

<p>&mdash;For instance ... Does it strike you that trade books have improved
in the twenty years?&mdash;as physical objects,&mdash;packages?</p>

<p>&mdash;Packages. Very neat. Sums up the situation.</p>

<p>&mdash;We mean, both as implements, tools, for getting a job done;
and as pleasant things to look at, handle, use ... or the contrary.</p>

<p>&mdash;Well. Let's see. Yes. I think trade books have improved decidedly
in twenty years. Decided improvement.</p>

<p>&mdash;What points of improvement, would you say?</p>

<p>&mdash;Well. More care taken with the get-up, margins, format as
you call it, title pages. Real design coming into it. And much
more careful about the type&mdash;legibility and all that&mdash;paper, suita<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[Pg 146]</span>bility
for reading, good surface for the eye, etc., etc.</p>

<p>&mdash;You said, twenty years ago, that your directors' lack of interest
in the product hampered you. Since you have been in charge
here have you been able to bring your books up to a level that
suits you better?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes ... and no.... Costs have climbed in twenty years,
materials, labor. We've pushed up retail prices, but the manufacturing
costs eat up all we gain. More than eat it up. Less margin
now for design or style or whatever than twenty years ago,
I'd say.</p>

<p>&mdash;That looks like faulty adjustment somewhere, doesn't it?</p>

<p>&mdash;Situation needs adjusting, certainly!</p>

<p>&mdash;I mean, maybe you are paying out money for quite unnecessary
features.</p>

<p>&mdash;Possibly.</p>

<p>&mdash;Not a strictly <em>factual</em> meeting of the conditions, perhaps?&mdash;not
"realistic," as the dictators say. Have you ever thought how
you might study the market-product relations from an entirely
new and fresh angle?</p>

<p>&mdash;Now there! ... that's interesting ... I have. I've thought a lot
about it. When I get off into the Maine woods and look back at
it there's one thing that sticks out like a sore thumb. We've got
into a rut. The whole trade has. Not a shadow of a doubt about it.
We let ourselves be ruled by a whole catalog of standards and
values and "musts" that are as dead as the dodo. Standards inherited
from an entirely different state of society. A thousand
years different, you might say. It is amazing how conservative a
tribe we are, we book people.... Take the cover of a book, for
example. Take this cover here, for instance. We spent a lot of
trouble and money dickering it up&mdash;worry about the colors and
the design&mdash;cost of dies, cost of stamping, cost of foil ... and not
a soul will ever see it! It's all hidden away under the jacket, and
it'll <em>stay</em> hidden under the jacket! All this book-cover stuff is ...
what's the word? ... vestigial&mdash;like your appendix&mdash;something no
longer used&mdash;something useless left over from an earlier stage of
evolution. Did you ever see anybody in a book store turn the
jacket back and look at the cover? Did you ever hear of a cover<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[Pg 147]</span>
that helped sell a book?&mdash;to the slightest extent? No. And when
they get 'em home and read 'em and lend them to their friends
the jacket stays on. Never comes off. Book-covers are just expense&mdash;useless
expense&mdash;the decoration and things, I mean.</p>

<p>&mdash;You would do away with covers, then?</p>

<p>&mdash;No. It's got to be in boards&mdash;people want them that way&mdash;it's
one of your "realistic" details.</p>

<p>&mdash;In your "new angle" volume would you have the insides as
you do them now?</p>

<p>&mdash;No. There again I'd let the demand shape the product. Your
market doesn't give a hang about the type and printing so long
as they can read it.</p>

<p>&mdash;That sounds like twenty years ago!</p>

<p>&mdash;I know. Very likely it does.</p>

<p>&mdash;Haven't things changed?</p>

<p>&mdash;Not much. It's as true now as it was then.</p>

<p>&mdash;But all this talking and writing and lecturing....</p>

<p>&mdash;Two or three thousand persons, perhaps&mdash;two or three thousand
have become "book conscious" as they say&mdash;the limited
edition crowd. I'm dealing with the ten million.... There's a lot
of whoosh in all that book beautiful stuff, you know.</p>

<p>&mdash;Mr. &mdash;&mdash; thinks it helps to tell them about type and paper,
etc.</p>

<p>&mdash;I know. It doesn't. They don't understand his little notices&mdash;it's
all shop talk. He likes 'em. He thinks they give the books tone,
I daresay. I think it doesn't matter a damn one way or the other.
All that shop detail is zero. They don't care to know and they
don't <em>need</em> to know. Just make your book so it will read handily
and let it go at that.</p>

<p>&mdash;Have you got this "new angle" idea to a point where you
could describe a book made that way?</p>

<p>&mdash;Well. I might. Take the cover&mdash;I'd have board covers and
cloth. But I wouldn't stamp them. Bright color. Gay. Patterned
cloth sometimes. I'd have the simplest kind of paper label on the
backbone. Printed from type&mdash;standard affair&mdash;library label that
you could read. No embroidery, just plain function. On the least
expensive terms possible. Make it a kind of house-trademark<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[Pg 148]</span>
feature.... Inside I'd forget all I knew about fine printing&mdash;the
art&mdash;it's a great art&mdash;forget all I knew&mdash;start fresh with the <em>use</em>.</p>

<p>&mdash;<em>You</em> like fine printing.</p>

<p>&mdash;That's right. I do. In its place. The place isn't trade books.
You can't have fine printing in trade books. All you can have
along <em>that</em> line is cheap imitation&mdash;celluloid collar and no shirt.
If you go out with your imitation fine printing as a mark to shoot
at you come back with what we turn out now, all of us&mdash;shabby
genteel, to the limit. My book won't try to get by with a paper
collar. My book won't have <em>any</em> collar. It will get down to the basis
of realism&mdash;a handy, efficient, <em>cheap</em> tool for temporary use. Read
it&mdash;throw it away. Who saves a book now? If you save it, where
are you going to put it? In the car?</p>

<p>&mdash;That suggests question of size&mdash;what do you think about size?</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh, small, by all means. For the usual job not larger than the
5-1/2x7-3/4 range. Smaller than that when you can.</p>

<p>&mdash;You think people do not want a big package for their money?</p>

<p>&mdash;Not when they want a book to read. If we can get the price
down they'll flock to small size, I'm sure. When they pay two-fifty,
three, perhaps they want their poundage. Books for gifts too, possibly&mdash;want
'em impressive. But on my basis of a good workable
tool they'll like them small and handy.</p>

<p>&mdash;Your point in general, then, is that modern books should be
looked at as temporary affairs.</p>

<p>&mdash;Absolutely. Temporary affairs. Like magazines. And they
ought to be <em>produced</em> as temporary affairs. Paper a little better
than newsprint, but not much better&mdash;better color, on the
warmish side instead of blue-grey. "Guaranteed by the Bureau
of Standards to last three hundred years." Bosh. Presswork: set
your standard at the level of legibility. That's low&mdash;look at the
newspapers. Get it so you can read it easily and let the fine points
ride. Give up points of paper and make-ready to get a cheaper
package. You are making a tool, remember, not a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bijou</i>&mdash;you're
making a sound, efficient, easy-working tool&mdash;tools don't need
paper lace and fake-leather upholstery to make them sound&mdash;when
a tool is efficient it has a style of its own, inevitably.</p>

<p>&mdash;Your dictum is, "books as tools."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>&mdash;Books as tools. Right. But here's a point. All this is on the
technical side. Treat a book as a temporary affair. But while it
lasts I'd take considerable pains to have it be a <em>lively</em> affair. Not
freakish&mdash;you can't play tricks with the reading process&mdash;but
lively, like a good, interesting talker. Little fresh twists, but hardly
noticeable in detail. A lot of ways to do it in an inconspicuous
way. Mustn't be conspicuous&mdash;mustn't interfere with the
reading job. Little touches of ornament in the right places. Pictorial
bits&mdash;pictures are coming back into trade books again, in a
new form&mdash;easy, swift, simple illustrations that fit in with the
"temporary affair" style. Some of the money saved by a strategic
retreat from impossible printing standards I'd put into things like
that&mdash;to keep the pages gay and interesting.</p>

<p>&mdash;In this connection, do you think that modern books ought to
be "modernistic" in design?</p>

<p>&mdash;Absolutely <em>not</em>. As I said a minute ago, you can't play tricks
with the process of reading.... One of the necessities of the
modernistic stuff is the necessity to shock you&mdash;to make people
jump. You can't set off firecrackers on a book page every few paragraphs
without taking the reader's mind off the text. You simply
can't read in the neighborhood of modernistic design. It isn't
because you are not used to it. It's in the very nature of the style....
I'm talking about books, of course. For advertising, it's prime.
Have all the modernistic design you want on your jacket. The
more the better.</p>

<p>&mdash;And that brings us....</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes. I've been waiting for it. That brings us to book-jackets!</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes. What do you think....</p>

<p>&mdash;Now <em>there</em> you are in another country entirely. Now's the
time to beat the drums and run up the flags and drape the bunting....
All the money you can't afford to spend on covers you <em>can</em>
afford to spend on jackets. Because, first, the jacket <em>is</em> the cover;
and second, the jacket helps directly in selling the book. Jackets
are advertising&mdash;posters&mdash;billboards&mdash;so make 'em shout.</p>

<p>&mdash;Attractive?</p>

<p>&mdash;If you mean <em>pretty</em>, not so important. If you mean oomph,
by all means. Feminine charm, in the prevailing mode.... But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[Pg 150]</span>
sock-'em-in-the-eye. Make them strong. Make them so people
can't miss seeing them.</p>

<p>&mdash;What is your own formula?</p>

<p>&mdash;Formula? I haven't any formula.... If I had I think it would
be <em>contrast</em>. Contrast with all the other books on the table. Don't
follow anybody's style. Get away from the prevalent "successful"
style of the moment. Take a look at the tables&mdash;what would stick
out now more than plain white paper with plain black type? I'd
probably varnish it. Contrast.</p>

<p>&mdash;Do jackets sell books?</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh ... no. Jackets don't sell books. They <em>help</em>. What sells a
book is the stuff inside&mdash;story&mdash;text. But books need to be <em>seen</em>.
Jackets help make them visible.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&mdash;You save on covers and spend on jackets. You save on paper
and printing, and put some of the saving into pictorial and design
features. Would you come out with enough saving to get the
retail price down from two fifty?</p>

<p>&mdash;I think so. I think if the thing were studied out on our "new
angle" basis you'd find that you not only liked my books a lot
better&mdash;as "packages"&mdash;but that you'd be able to buy more of
them.</p>


<p class="p1 center">M<small>R</small>. A.</p>

<p>Q: One thing I wanted to ask ... you have had a considerable part
in shaping your juvenile department.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes. I have.</p>

<p>&mdash;My question may seem a little ... cool.... Do you prepare
your juvenile titles with the children themselves in view&mdash;the ultimate
consumers?</p>

<p>&mdash;The question's quite proper. I am glad you asked it&mdash;it goes
straight to the heart of a big trouble about children's books....
The children themselves in view, eh? The ultimate consumers....
No. I am sorry to say, we do not. We can't. Because children do
not buy books.... You see, a juvenile, like any other book on our
list, has to please the person that's likely to buy it. And that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[Pg 151]</span>
means, a book to please adults&mdash;a book that a grown-up will mark
down as something a child ought to like. <em>Ought</em> to, you see&mdash;the
adult's judgment, not the child's. We can't get past it. We can't
find out what the child really <em>does</em> like. When children rally to an
author, or a style of book, then we get a glimpse of the children's
state of mind. But that is our only contact.... All our <em>new</em> ventures
have to be baited and primed to catch the fancy of the
mothers and the cousins and the aunts&mdash;<em>against</em> the interests of
the ultimate consumer, you might say, when that is necessary.
Sometimes a juvenile runs to large sales purely on the strength of
adult appreciation alone, like Ferdinand, for instance.... If it
were possible, there is nothing I should like better than to deal
with the children direct. I have children of my own. I think I understand
them ... to a certain extent. I think I could please them.
Once or twice&mdash;this is a confession&mdash;I did take a direct hand&mdash;made
a couple the way I thought they ought to be. <em>My</em> judgment
against the child's, eh?... Complete failures&mdash;drugs.... I couldn't
move them&mdash;couldn't get past the censor&mdash;couldn't sell the
grown-ups.</p>

<p>&mdash;Have you ever thought of ways for getting into direct touch
with the children?</p>

<p>&mdash;I can see no practicable way. As the case stands you can't
penetrate the Adult Front Line.</p>


<p class="p1 center">M<small>R</small>. L.</p>

<p>Q: This scheme of Mr. McG.'s for a different kind of book&mdash;what
do you think of it?</p>

<p>&mdash;If he can <em>control</em> his "decline from a high estate" I am with
him, emphatically. Books need to be cheaper. Books <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i> market
certainly need to be studied all over again&mdash;from a new base
line. I agree with his findings about shabby-genteel. And I'm sure
that I'd like his "cheap" books much better than the kind I buy
now, <em>if</em> he can liven them up as he suggests. The question is, can
he stop his "strategic retreat" at the right point? It's like inflation:
easy to start, but...! He drops the standard of material and
process&mdash;will his proofreading go down hill too?... Many French
books in paper wrappers&mdash;made at the lowest cost-level, badly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[Pg 152]</span>
printed on cheap paper&mdash;have an air and a style that our own more
expensive affairs can't quite achieve. <em>Somebody</em> laid a finger on
them. Who, in Mr. McG.'s scheme, is to be this somebody whose
touch creates liveliness and interest? A highly important factor
in the product!... If we <em>can</em> get the liveliness and interest, we will
be glad to trade more expensive paper and printing to get it. Our
books are pretty dull.... But, <em>just</em> inferior printing on cheap
paper, <em>without</em> the lively touch and style, is going to bore us worse
yet!</p>

<p>&mdash;You mean dull in content?</p>

<p>&mdash;I mean dull optically, visually.... Like&mdash;to put it into terms
of sound&mdash;like a long, droning recital of a tedious story&mdash;no inflection&mdash;no
climax&mdash;no motion. ... I like Mr. McG.'s figure of
a "good, interesting talker."</p>

<p>&mdash;You'd spice it up with "modernist" feeling?</p>

<p>&mdash;No. He's right, there. No fireworks. Keep the explosions <em>outside</em>
the book.</p>

<p>&mdash;<em>You</em> have used "contemporary" design.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, but you'll notice, not in places where <em>reading</em> is going on....
Another point: letting the market set the <em>tone</em> is not good
merchandising. The market needs to be led, by a tone a little
higher than its average taste.... And Mr. McG.'s good tool isn't
made by majority vote in Congressional committee&mdash;it's made by
somebody who knows, expertly and practically, just what the tool
is intended to do and how it works.</p>

<p>&mdash;You are for "books as tools."</p>

<p>&mdash;I am for books as tools&mdash;and that means cheaper books....
I think, too, that a lot of the things that make books expensive are
false value&mdash;brummagem.... But the trade is so firmly established
in the tradition of false-front and bustle-rear that I'm afraid it's
going to take an awful tussle to get it back to real values again&mdash;to
the tool basis&mdash;to the simplicity and directness and general fitness-for-its-job,
for example, that makes a carpenter's plane a
masterpiece of appropriate design.</p>

<p>We live in an unhappy age. I suppose that it must be the most
wretched known in history since the hordes of Genghis Khan
swept across the face of the eastern world. Yet it is not the physical
losses&mdash;though these are bad enough&mdash;which are responsible for
the malaise, but a spiritual shortcoming: a lack of direction and
a lack of faith. Ours is an age in which there is no single thing,
not great or small, which can escape our petty probing, our
questioning and our doubts. Nothing is because it is: a shadowy
reason must be sought behind.</p>

<p>In the course of man's desire to examine and explain away
everything, one of the multitudinous minutiæ which have come
in for worried attention is the position of printers, particularly in
relation to the publishers they serve. The first four centuries of
printing produced ninety-nine per cent of all the books which
are worth looking at: yet, at what time during that period did
anyone worry about the division of responsibility in a book's
production? Then, it was a matter which somehow got done;
now, unfortunately, it is a subject for discussion.</p>

<p>When Sweynheim and Pannertz started work at Subiaco in
1465 they were at the same time both printers and publishers,
and this represents a dual personality. But when Fichet, the
Rector of the Sorbonne, decided to set up the first French press
five years later within the precincts of the University, he imported
three printers from Germany, and possibly the first printer-publisher
relationship was born. That this relationship was a living
thing is shown by the fact that Fichet had the books which the
press produced printed in Roman type. Soon after the great Rector
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[Pg 154]</span>had gone into voluntary exile for his political opinions, the press
moved out of the University precincts to become a normal commercial
printing shop, and Gering and Krantz reverted to the
use of gothic type! Since the use of Roman lay within the high
road of French classical development&mdash;France being the only
country in Europe which did not begin its printing history in
gothic&mdash;this stands as the first instance of the views of a publisher,
as a man ordering the print, being in advance of the more timorous
craftsmen, who were glad to revert to their old, safe and conventional
ways as soon as the refining influence was removed.</p>

<p>French printing as a whole in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth
centuries is full of printer-publisher problems for our
questing minds. Simon le Vostre, the great ecclesiastical publisher
of his age, used Pigouchet mostly for his printing; the Hardouyn
brothers commissioned several lovely books from Anabat: why,
and who dictated the terms? The balance of power may then well
have lain with the printer, since in the Hardouyn's 1500 <cite>Book of
Hours</cite> the first page is filled with Anabat's superb device. But
what shall we say of the <cite>Hours</cite> printed in 1527 by Simon du Bois,
but which bears on every page the unmistakable stamp and signature
of its publisher, Geoffroy Tory? Now, they say, too, that
Tory was not a binder: yet from him we have two gilt panels
done to his order and to his design, matching exactly the work
which he hired his printers to do for him.</p>

<p>I feel we are too certain in our minds that in the past printers
were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</i> publishers, or that those "for" whom they printed
were merely agents. Like a fatal crack hidden for many years
in the foundations of an outwardly sound edifice, the split between
printer and publisher had occurred at the Sorbonne in
1470, but was patched, mended and ignored from time to time
for long thereafter. Yet like that neglected flaw which, having
widened until it defies repair, will in the end bring the whole
building down, the printer-publisher relationship has now some
time ago irrevocably divided.</p>

<p>Today the publisher and the printer are two separate men:
there are few exceptions to this rule. Mr. Oliver Simon recently
began one of his all too rare essays with the words "Printing is
a way of life"; and later he remarked that "if he (the printer)
is not something of an artist, he cannot hope to evolve and maintain
a typographic style." But these words must be read in con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[Pg 155]</span>junction
with one of Holbrook Jackson's many wise remarks:
"whether it (printing) is an art or not is a secondary affair, so
long as it is good printing. 'Art happens' says Whistler, and the
printer who sets out to be an artist is liable to make a mess of both
art and print." One further quotation will show how readily Holbrook
Jackson's wisdom can be thrown out of the window; in
these pages last year Mr. Herbert Read criticised the English and
American editions of his own book, <cite>The Grass Roots of Art</cite>. He
wrote "On balance, I do not find much to choose between these
two designs from a functional point of view, but discounting a
poverty due to material restrictions imposed on the English publisher,
there is a certain liveliness in the American production,
which, were I a purchaser faced with a choice, would induce
me to buy the American edition, even if it cost me rather more.
But if the English edition had been printed on better paper, it
would have been the easier of the two editions to read...." With
the exception of the last sentence, the whole of this passage seems
misleading and irrelevant. The use of the word "functional" is
one of the crosses which we in the twentieth century have to
bear, but, since it has occurred, we must presume the function of
printing to be that of presenting the written word to the reader
in its most easily assimilated form; if the English edition in question
is, apart from its paper, more easily readable, how can both
editions be equally functional? The implication that a piece of
printing&mdash;particularly when the text is a work of serious criticism&mdash;is
to be purchased (even at a higher price) for its liveliness at
the expense of its readability is particularly unfortunate. If for
"liveliness" we read "speciousness" or "pretention" we have found
a ready definition of the one quality which should be excluded
from book printing at almost any cost. For this reason I am
frightened of Mr. Simon's statement that "printing is a way of
life"; good printing implies a philosophy, it is true, but I fear
that printers who are far from good may assume airs above their
station and, when they produce a perfect horror, state "that is
my way of life&mdash;take it or leave it." If they do, they may be astonished
at how fast any decent publisher will embrace the latter
course. I disagree with a great deal more which Mr. Read wrote
in his article, but there is room here for comment only upon
his remarks about Baskerville type. Baskerville is <em>not</em> an easy type,
nor a safe one (though printers may find that it satisfies their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[Pg 156]</span>
customers). The "gentlemanly sort of type which passes unnoticed,
unquestioned" is undoubtedly Caslon and all its derivatives.
Baskerville with its broad face and flourishing Italic is hard
to handle, and in consequence is employed in a higher percentage
of bad printing than any other type face.</p>

<p>It is generally agreed that when an irresistible force meets an
immovable body, the result is a stalemate; equally obviously,
whichever power wanes first will suffer an immediate eclipse.
From this we may proceed by a process of elimination. A publisher
who knows what he wants employs a printer who is an
artist, and the result should be a masterpiece of give and take. A
publisher who does not know what he wants employs a printer
who is an artist, and the result should be a piece of fine printing.
A publisher who knows what he wants employs a printer who is
not an artist, and the result will depend on the degree of taste of
the publisher. A publisher who either does not know what he
wants or does not care, and employs a printer who is not an artist,
will both get and deserve a shambles. From these simple equations
one constant factor emerges&mdash;the publisher; and this fact is not
at all at variance with the traditional saw that he who pays the
piper calls the tune.</p>

<p>There have been a number of eminent publisher-printer relationships
in the past. I have mentioned the French of 1500-1550,
where there seems already to be evidence of a publisher's taste
exerting an influence. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
offer no examples which are worthy of study: the works undertaken
by one printer on behalf of a syndicate of publishers produce
no evidence of the book's appearance being dictated by any
taste other than that of the printer himself.</p>

<p>The nineteenth century saw the publisher come into his own.
One of the greatest publisher-printer partnerships in the history
of British book-production is that of Pickering and Whittingham.
It would be reasonable to suppose that Pickering was the
moving force in this partnership, since the ideas are publishing
ideas mainly exemplified by the Aldine poets and the Diamond
classics, and their starting point is Pickering's choice of the
anchor and dolphin with the motto grouped about it: <cite>Aldi Discip.
Anglus</cite>. To the same taste of Pickering and his delight in the
printing of Aldus and his contemporaries may be attributed the
gracious and restrained use of sixteenth-century fleurons which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[Pg 157]</span>
in the eighteen-thirties are not readily to be found elsewhere, and
the curiously appropriate renaissance borders occasionally introduced.
Another partnership in which I suspect that the publisher
had a considerable say was that of Edward Moxon and Bradbury
&amp; Evans. In 1850 Moxon issued the first edition of two most important
works, Wordsworth's <cite>Prelude</cite> and Tennyson's <cite>In Memoriam</cite>;
both were printed by the same printer. But eight years
later we may point to John Murray's edition of Coleridge's <cite>Table
Talk</cite>; this, too, was printed by Bradbury &amp; Evans with more than
a glance over the shoulder at Pickering's publications, but without
the guiding hand of Moxon. It is an interesting book, for it
just fails before every problem which the text sets. Pickering
would have set the solid prose at least a point smaller and increased
the margins; in the same way he would have managed to
get more space between each specimen of <cite>Table Talk</cite>. Instead of
a page of grace and readability, there is in consequence a slightly
crowded air and the eye skips disconcertingly from line to line.</p>

<p>Little more than thirty years later British book production was
influenced by the most powerful small group of publishers which
had ever turned printing upside down: it was indeed a small group&mdash;it
consisted of three men: John Lane, Elkin Mathews and Leonard
Smithers. The splendid series of publications for which each
of these extraordinary individuals was responsible need no enumeration
here ... but it is worth pointing out that they were the
pioneers of the asymmetry which Mr. Read praises as an unusual
and notable feature in the American edition of his book
already mentioned. Holbrook Jackson said the last word on the
publisher-printer relationship: "it was publishers like Pickering,
Moxon, Field and Tuer, Elkin Mathews, John Lane and J. M.
Dent who by their example in the nineteenth century helped to
<em>defend</em> [my italics] printing from printers who were content to
do as they were told, and, if no one told them, to follow rule-of-thumb
methods which tended always to become worse rather
than better."<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>


<p>To quote again from Holbrook Jackson: "It was long before
the average printer took advantage of the awakening of typographical
taste which began in the eighteen-nineties. The men
who extended and consolidated that taste came from anywhere
but the printing offices. The majority of modern typographers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[Pg 158]</span>are intellectuals or scholars who have forced themselves on the
trade, often through the publishing houses." In almost every age
there have been a few commercial printers of first-class standing,
but perhaps it is no coincidence that it would be difficult to name
one who was at work in the eighteen-nineties&mdash;the most lively
age of the publisher's influence. The situation has not materially
changed by the middle of the twentieth century, except that in
our own age we are fortunate in having among us a few printers
who bow to no man, and have left their mark upon this country's
production. First among them stands Mr. Oliver Simon, whose
steady output of fine printing must command unqualified admiration.
Both the Cambridge and the Oxford University Presses
have evolved styles of their own, and there are a few others who
are fine printers in their own right. But on the other side of the
ledger there is Sir Francis Meynell, who, despite the criticism that
much of his work is pastiche, showed with exquisite taste [in the
first hundred Nonesuch Press books] what could be made of the
types and ornaments which Mr. Stanley Morison had made available
through the Monotype Corporation, and all this with a multitude
of printers who were set to work and produced but one
result&mdash;pure Meynell. There is also the more recent example of
Mr. Jan Tschichold at work in the Penguin pool.</p>

<p>This lamentable lack of taste among the generality of printers
led publishers to give instructions as to their wishes, and this in
turn has created a new position in publishing offices: the typographer.
Once this person made his appearance on the payroll, the
initiative passed from the printer for ever. In the first place, if the
publisher employs a typographer he is going to be sure he gets
his money's worth; in the second, human nature being what it is,
most printers will willingly accept a publisher's design because
it is the line of least resistance, and because, according to the
best principles of business, the customer is always right.</p>

<p>I cannot see why the initiative in design should ever pass back
to the printer. The problem was admirably expressed by D. B.
Updike in his little book of essays on the craft, <cite>In the Day's
Work</cite>: "If printers had more of a standard and a stiffer one, both
about the types they employ and the way in which they use them,
printing would be better. The printer, if he has no standard, <em>must</em>
allow the customer to dictate his own wishes about types." I hope
that there will always be the handful of printers who are great
enough to say "you will do it my way&mdash;or else," but the rest will
do as they are told by publishers' typographers, which amounts
to the substitution of house styles for printers' styles. Printing,
like so many arts, has fallen into the hands of the middleman&mdash;for
such indeed the publisher is. There I am sure it will remain,
and it is now for the middleman to justify himself. If he will
take his responsibilities seriously he can do nothing but good.
The good printer's compositor who is "something of an artist"
will go on setting the target; but the publisher's typographer can,
if he will, go far towards dragging the mediocre printers up towards
the same high standard. If this is done, design in British
printing will show a welcome overall improvement.</p>

<p>The experienced designer is familiar with the successive parts
of a complete book. All less formal embodiments of the book idea
have some of these parts, and their position in the whole scheme
should be governed by the traditions of the book proper.</p>

<p>In order to leave complete freedom as to number of pages, the
favorite custom is to number the text pages in arabic folio numbers,
beginning with 1. The front pages are then numbered with
Roman folios, and thus it makes no difference with the body how
many or few front pages are finally found necessary.</p>

<p>The typographical treatment of front matter and chapter pages
throughout the book should be in perfect harmony, whether the
treatment is simple typography or calls for elaborate embellishment.
The character of the book is largely decided by what is
done in this respect, and the intelligent designer fully realizes its
importance and the chance thus given him for distinguished work.</p>

<p>The following summary gives these parts in proper sequence,
and the nature of each.</p>


<p class="p1 center">BASTARD TITLE (<em>always a right-hand page</em>)</p>

<p>Nowadays this page (often miscalled "Half Title") is used
merely because custom demands the familiar resting place for
the eye in advance of the Title Page. It should never be omitted
in work of any pretension to style and quality, and it should
never be made unduly prominent by decoration or other treatment.
Conventional dignity is the safe note for this page in the
book.</p>


<p class="p1 center">ADVERTISING CARD (<em>always a left-hand page</em>)</p>

<p>If an Advertising Card or other similar announcement is required,
it should be typographically a part of the book, no mat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[Pg 161]</span>ter
what the client's style in his advertising typography may be.
If a customer has a special or unique form of advertising, and
insists on its use, the printer should inform him that it conflicts
with the harmony of the book to do so.</p>


<p class="p1 center">THE TITLE PAGE (<em>always a right-hand page</em>)</p>

<p>The Title Page gives the reader his sense of the whole book's
quality. It should, therefore, be as nearly perfect as may be. Its
first essential is that the eye shall read instantly the three important
facts that it has to tell: the title of the book, the name
of the author, and the imprint. In the case of a business volume
this means the merchandise or business subject, the name of the
business house, and the address or addresses. The typography
should make these three divisions clear at a glance. There should
be as little else on the title page as possible. Everything that can be
left out is an aid to quality. The principle of the page is that it is
an announcement of the book's contents and that it should not go
beyond a very few display lines. It is the door to the house. White
space is of the greatest value in this part of the book. If decoration
is used, it should never be made more important than the type
lines. The use of different faces of type is almost always bad,
and success is obtained only occasionally by a genius. So important
is harmony that it is not safe even to combine lines of
capitals and lower case letters, except after careful planning and
with assured understanding and talent.</p>


<p class="p1 center">COPYRIGHT (<em>always a left-hand page</em>)</p>

<p>The Copyright of the volume should be placed a little above
the center of the page. The best taste calls for caps and small
caps, or small caps alone. It is customary to use the bottom of
this page for the printer's imprint or the international requirement,
"Printed in the United States of America," or both, but
the size of page should be considered.</p>


<p class="p1 center">DEDICATION (<em>always a right-hand page</em>)</p>

<p>The character and purpose of the Dedication dictate that its
treatment should always be formal. The "monumental" style is
appropriate and correct. Small caps are the best. The Dedication<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[Pg 162]</span>
should always be a right-hand page. Its reverse must be left
blank.</p>


<p class="p1 center">PREFACE [<small>OR</small> F<small>OREWORD</small>] (<em>always a right-hand page</em>)</p>

<p>A Preface that has simply the ordinary character usual to most
prefaces should be set in the same size of type as the body of the
book, and in the same face. For any preface of unusual importance,
the page may be double-leaded, or set in a type one
size larger than the body. If the book has both Preface and Introduction,
the Preface may be set in italics to mark the distinction.
Italics may also be employed if the Preface has been written
by a person other than the author. In this case, however, the
Preface is preferably placed after the Contents and the List of
Illustrations.</p>


<p class="p1 center">CONTENTS (<em>always a right-hand page</em>)</p>

<p>The Contents or Table of Contents, filling as many pages as
necessary, follows the Preface. The quality of this part of the
book-job depends on the little niceties of spacing, margin, and
proportion of white space to type which are too often ignored,
even in otherwise pretentious books. The Contents pages are
almost as important as the Title Page in establishing a sense of
quality.</p>


<p class="p1 center">THE LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS (<em>always a right-hand page</em>)</p>

<p>The List of Illustrations follows the Contents pages, but no
matter where the Contents finishes, the List of Illustrations should
begin on a right-hand page. Obviously its typographical style
should be the same as the Contents.</p>


<p class="p1 center">INTRODUCTION (<em>always a right-hand page</em>)</p>

<p>The Introduction follows the List of Illustrations, and its composition
should be in the same size and face as the body of the
book. Any typographical distinction between Preface and Introduction
should be limited to the former, as stated under
"Preface." Authors are not always clear in their understanding
of the difference between a Preface and an Introduction. Their
Introduction often is really a Preface, and should be so entitled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[Pg 163]</span>
and placed in the book accordingly. The Preface is the author's
personal remarks to the reader, and these may be of any character,
treating of any subject. The Introduction, on the other
hand, should treat specifically of the subject of the book, and
should contain only statements of direct bearing and importance.</p>


<p class="p1 center">HALF TITLE (<em>always a right-hand page</em>)</p>

<p>As the Bastard Title always precedes the Title Page, so the
Half Title always precedes the first page of the text&mdash;the page
which carries the title of the book at its top. The Half Title
must always be on the right-hand page immediately preceding
this page, and it should consist of not more than the title of the
volume. Half Titles may run through a book before various
divisions.</p>

<p>Those sections of a book which follow the text must be treated
with the same typographic care as the pages which precede the
text. These sections are usually as follows:</p>


<p class="p1 center">APPENDIX (<em>always a right-hand page</em>)</p>

<p>This should be set in the same face as the text, but in one size
smaller type. If the text ends on the left-hand page, a Half Title
may be thrown between the text and the Appendix.</p>


<p class="p1 center">GLOSSARY (<em>preferably a right-hand page</em>)</p>

<p>The size of type used for the Glossary depends wholly upon
its nature, but it usually is two full sizes smaller than that used in
the text of the volume. A Half Title may be thrown in before
the Glossary, if the text ends on the left-hand page.</p>


<p class="p1 center">BIBLIOGRAPHY (<em>preferably a right-hand page</em>)</p>

<p>The comments made under "Glossary" apply equally to the
Bibliography. The combination of titles of books and the names
of authors offers an attractive opportunity for artistic treatment.</p>


<p class="p1 center">INDEX (<em>always a right-hand page</em>)</p>

<p>If the text ends on the left-hand page, a Half Title may be
thrown in before the Index. The type used for the Index is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[Pg 164]</span>
usually 8 point size set in double column. There is so much difference
in the way the index entries read that great care should
be exercised to select a model which will fit the particular case
in hand.</p>

<p>A SYMPOSIUM: <em>By Bruce Rogers, Carl Purington Rollins,
Joseph Blumenthal, P. J. Conkwright, Arthur W. Rushmore,
Milton Glick, Morris Colman, Evelyn Harter, Peter Beilenson
and Ernst Reichl.</em></p></div>

<p>Have there been any material changes in the anatomy of the
book in the past quarter century? Should there be, to have the
contemporary book reflect the times in which it is designed, set
and printed?</p>

<p>As these and other questions occurred, we re-appraised the
Anatomy of the Book summation in <cite>The Manual of Linotype
Typography</cite>, reprinted in the foregoing pages. That text seemed
to stand up pretty well. It was written originally by William
Dana Orcutt for the <cite>Manual</cite>, whose typographical plan and
critical comment was prepared with the co-operation of the late
Edward E. Bartlett, then Director of Linotype Typography.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What revisions or additions would Mr. Orcutt suggest for a
reprinting? What would other prominent designers and book-makers
suggest?</p>

<p>The idea of a symposium appealed. The counsel of Bruce
Rogers, Carl Purington Rollins and Joseph Blumenthal, in the
field of fine and privately printed books, was invited, with that
of P. J. Conkwright in the university press field.</p>

<p>Trade book-makers would also have opinions and suggestions,
in all probability. Counsel was sought from Milton Glick, who
heads the Viking Press design and production activity; Morris
Colman, former chairman of the A.I.G.A. Trade Book Clinic
and one of Viking's top designers; Arthur W. Rushmore, former
Harper vice-president in charge of design and production, now
retired to the delights of his Golden Hind Press, at Madison,
N. J.; and Ernst Reichl, one of our ranking modern designers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[Pg 165]</span>
whose long association in book manufacturing with H. Wolff
and as a free-lance brought an unmatched experience in working
with many publishers. Mr. Reichl also has been prominent in
A.I.G.A. Book and Magazine Clinic activities.</p>

<p>The comment of an author and a publisher also seemed in
order, and happily one in each field with a considerable appreciation
of the graphic arts was obtained: Evelyn Harter, whose
novel, <cite>Dr. Katherine Bell</cite>, was recently published by Doubleday,
and who formerly headed design and production activity for
Random House, Smith and Haas and other firms before retiring
to private life as Mrs. Milton Glick. As publisher-designer-printer
all in one, Peter Beilenson was invited to comment. He, with Mrs.
Edna Beilenson, directs the Peter Pauper Press in Mt. Vernon,
and is consistently represented in the A.I.G.A. "Fifty Books of
the Year" selections.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"So far as I know," Mr. Orcutt wrote, "the Anatomy remains
the same today and I can think of no changes I would want to
make. I may be wrong, but I am still hoping that it is one thing
that doesn't change."</p>

<p>To Joseph Blumenthal, who directs the Spiral Press in New
York, and whose books are famed for their simplicity of design
and excellence of typography and presswork, the statements of
the Anatomy are sane and safe. "In the hands of a sufficiently
experienced and versatile designer," he added, "no rule is absolute
to the point where it cannot be broken, at least in part, where
occasion requires."</p>

<p>To Bruce Rogers, most distinguished of designers of books,
the Anatomy "is an excellent short treatise that covers all the
points of a well-designed volume.... I recommend it for the
perusal of anyone engaged in book-making. Following it literally
would result in a decided advance in that art."</p>

<p>Several minor suggestions that B.R. made have been incorporated
in the text of the Anatomy as here reprinted. These
concerned the substitution of "should" for "must" in several
instances, "in order not to be too dogmatic." His other points
were: 1, "that it is frequently preferable to place the preface
before the contents"; and 2, "that there seem to be too many
half-titles recommended for anything else than a de luxe book&mdash;especially
at the end, for the index and vocabulary."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>To Carl Purington Rollins, Printer Emeritus to Yale University,
lecturer and writer on the graphic arts and one of the foremost
American masters of the book, the Anatomy "is a very
sound and sensible guide for young book makers&mdash;and, to judge
from the queer books coming out of New York, older ones could
profit from it. I have no disagreement with it in any particular,"
he continued, "and if it will not make a genius, it will at least
prevent a diligent reader from going astray."</p>

<p>P. J. Conkwright found the text clear and concise. "Any extensive
elaboration would defeat its usefulness, I think, to those
approaching the subject for the first time.</p>

<p>"My only quarrel," he added, "is with the paragraph concerning
Copyright. If there is no Dedication I like the Copyright
statement and printer's imprint grouped together a little above
the center of the page. If there is a Dedication, I like the Copyright
statement at the top of the page lining with the top line of
the title page, and the printer's imprint at the bottom of the page,
lining with the bottom line of the title page.</p>

<p>"This is a good example, however, of how an elaboration of the
text can get too involved for a beginner."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To several experienced trade-book designers with considerable
production and manufacturing experience, the Anatomy text
was less satisfactory.</p>

<p>Both Evelyn Harter and Milton Glick found the text too
dogmatic in its dicta. They were bothered most by the first two
sentences under Copyright, the last sentence under title page and
"references to 'genius.'" They both liked best the remarks regarding
Contents, Preface and Introduction.</p>

<p>"Ought not the topics of chapter openings be included," Mr.
Glick inquired, "also illustrations, captions, running page heads,
folios and such?"</p>

<p>As an ex-designer turned author, Miss Harter has "come to
appreciate more than ever the values of legibility and simplicity,
with no extraneous tricks."</p>

<p>Morris Colman concurred in feeling the Anatomy text is pretty
arbitrary for today, and that chapter openings, running page
heads and all other normal elements of a book should be included.</p>

<p>"In particular," he added, "I would like to see the various
arguments presented both in terms of tradition and also in terms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[Pg 167]</span>
of the particular function which each element of a book performs.</p>

<p>"For example, the title page is not only the 'main entrance' but
it also is the source of the bibliographic information which appears
in hundreds of library cards, catalogs, etc., and its contents
and arrangement determines whether it will be listed in all these
places in such form that you or I could find it if we wanted it.</p>

<p>"There are certain legal requirements which influence the form
and content of copyright pages. Dedications, while formal in a
technical sense, may need to be treated quite informally to express
the spirit of the particular dedicator.</p>

<p>"And with many kinds of contemporary books," he continued,
"the contents page is made to precede any other preliminary
matter, despite tradition, for the greater convenience of the
reader. I am sure that this is always why the Index is invariably
the last element in back matter."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To Arthur Rushmore, the Anatomy "is darn good copy, clearly
stated. There are a couple of amplifications that might help give
more clarity:</p>

<p>"<cite>Advertising Card</cite> seems a little vague. This is more likely to
be a 'List of Author's Books' or 'Series Title and Titles of Books
already issued' if the book is in a historical or other series.</p>

<p>"<em>Copyright</em>: Relatively few books carry the Printer's name on
copyright and the line 'Printed in the United States of America'
looks better and obviates a printing problem if run as a line directly
under the copyright notice. A single line at the foot of the
page, after the first 500 impressions of 1951 printing, is either
bold face or completely unreadable.</p>

<p>"<em>Dedication</em>: To me, 'small caps are the best' is doubtful. Small
caps are the worst printing of all characters in a font, and unless
small caps of a larger size than text will look too weak and small.
I'd say 'should be planned with the utmost care for balance and
position on page.'</p>

<p>"<em>Half Title</em>: First paragraph too dogmatic. If book is a novel,
or book without 'Parts' then half title should be 'book title' backed
blank and folioed in Roman front matter. If book has 'Parts,' the
half title should not bear book title, but should carry the Part or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[Pg 168]</span>
Section Title and folio arabic 1, backed blank 2 and first page
of text folio 3. Similar half title for all other Parts or Sections
folioed in."</p>

<p>Peter Beilenson, whose comment on the pleasures and duties of
the amateur printer is well worth reading (page 313), thinks the
Anatomy "perfectly all right, so far as it goes. If it wavers from
the perfect, it is in being too strict&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vide</i> the remarks about the
title page, the "it should never" of the bastard title, etc.</p>

<p>"But," he asks in suggesting the text be extended, "what about
additions to the coverage? Footnotes, running heads, chapter
titles, initials, etc., are not the limbs of the anatomy, but they are
organs. What about the binding? The jacket? The direction of
the stamping of the title on the spine?"</p>

<p>To Ernst Reichl, the Anatomy comprises "what might be
called the basic minimum. Any designer worth his salt should
not only start with this standard but also allow his imagination
to roam far beyond it.</p>

<p>"An 'anatomy,' however precise and objective, necessarily
breaks down a living entity into component parts. These parts in
reality show much more cohesion than is apparent in their piece-by-piece
description.</p>

<p>"In the modern book, in particular, we tend to treat the volume
as a whole and to submerge the importance of the single page in
it. The bastard title, for instance, might be left entirely blank;
the title page may be spread over two pages and the advertising
card incorporated into it; the copyright page and the dedication
page might be treated as a double-page spread, etc.</p>

<p>"The tendency today," he summarized, "is altogether to handle
the double-page spread as the unit of the layout, rather than the
single page. This may help to break down in some degree the
rigidity and formality which awes ordinary human beings, and
makes them as reluctant to touch a book as to put on a dress suit.
It may also help to make our books a little more ordinary and
lively."</p>

<em><small>Trade Bookmaking</small></em>:<br />
<small>COMPLAINT IN THREE DIMENSIONS</small></h2>

<p class="p22 center small1">From <cite>Publishers' Weekly</cite>, Oct. 5, 1935. Copyright 1935 by R. R. Bowker Co.
Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</p>

<p>The development of trade book-making since 1920 has been
an extraordinary phenomenon in the conservative business of
publishing. At that time most publishers looked upon "manufacturing"
as a necessary but routine activity, ranking with accounting,
shipping and such, and on a far lower intellectual plane than
the cultivation of authors and reviewers, or the writing of good
blurbs. The production of books was usually entrusted to an
uninspired saint who was expected to be hard on his printer's
back and soft under his boss's feet. The idea of the publisher himself
taking any interest in the <em>aesthetics</em> of book-making was
thought to be a trifle queer.</p>

<p>There was, to be sure, a small traffic in books printed for collectors,
and the term "fine printing" had already come to mean
"not printed to be read." Typography, as usual, was less than
twenty years behind current architecture, and American type
founders had already cleaned up the Renaissance and were well
on their way into the eighteenth century, while American typographers,
like interior decorators, were learning to hop nimbly
from period to period. Everyone was learning to blame the machine
for the things we were too greedy or too lazy to do properly;
fortunately small power presses could be made to imitate
hand-press printing, so it was not really necessary to do business
at hand-press rates.</p>

<p>In the field of general publishing, however, the hand-press page
was out of the question, period styles were incongruous, and the
real problem of designing the trade book had never been attempted,
because it had never been seen with any clarity. There
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[Pg 170]</span>were many experiments with new binding materials and designs,
and with printers' flowers and other typographic embellishment,
but these were all attempts to "dress up" the old formats, and
arose from no real understanding of the problem.</p>

<p>Today [1935], thanks to the leadership of a very few publishers,
the educational work of the American Institute of Graphic Arts,
and perhaps to the enthusiasm of the designers themselves, there
is a steadily widening appreciation of good trade book-making,
and a better perception of the problem among book-makers. We
are learning to plan books in <em>three</em> dimensions, considering proportion
and weight and the texture of materials&mdash;designing for
the hand as well as for the eyes. We are getting free of "period"
styles and "period" motifs, and developing a new idiom to suit
new methods of production. We are finally trying to make the
physical aspect of our books bear some relation to the culture of
our own time.</p>

<p>Everyone has come to recognize certain aesthetic values in
cheap machine-made glass and metal-ware, if it be designed for
the machine and does not attempt to imitate the hand-made, and
we find in it a quality different from, but not necessarily inferior
to, that of the more elegant article. Thus in printing we are coming
to realize that electrotyped plates, made from machine-set
type and printed on wood-pulp paper on a perfecting cylinder
press can produce a page quite as satisfactory, aesthetically, as the
product of the hand-press. It is this new sense of values, born of
respect for the machine and for what it can do if used with character,
that must be the basis of the designer's attitude. If he is
working with his fingers crossed, his work will show it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The problem of suiting type to subject is the cause of much
confusion. We give too little study to the characteristics of type-faces,
and the announcements of the foundries and composing-machine
people frequently attribute the most fantastic qualities
to their new types.</p>

<p>Furthermore, most of the faces available on the composing
machines have been cut to reproduce some earlier design, and
few to meet the contemporary technical or literary requirements,
so that we have several great gaps in the line of type resources that
need to be filled. Recent books examined, and a great part of all
current book-making, show that we have largely thrown off the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[Pg 171]</span>
reactionary hand-press ideal, and that we are learning to construct
instead of decorate. We have finally obtained a supply of
modern book cloth; Europe has given us a supply of modern display
types; and we are anxiously awaiting the composing-machine
companies' arrival in the Twentieth Century.</p>


<p><em>Two years later</em>:</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>From <cite>Publishers' Weekly</cite>, April 3, 1937. Copyright 1937 by R. R. Bowker Co.

<p>The end of a three-hour period spent examining a month's output
of American trade books leaves one thinking much more
about the book making situation in general than about the four
books one has chosen. What impresses one is not that four books,
or forty, are decently made, but that all the rest are so badly made.</p>

<p>After my last experience in inspecting a collection of this
kind, I wrote, with some satisfaction and much optimism: "We
are learning to plan books in <em>three</em> dimensions ... designing for
the hand as well as for the eye.... We are finally trying to make
the physical aspect of our books bear some relation to the culture
of our own time." Well, I still think we are only <em>trying</em>.</p>

<p>Designing a book is a problem in <em>three</em> dimensions. The first
essential is good and suitable materials, the second good proportions,
the third a good type, and the last good typographic arrangement.
Good decoration (or any decoration) is not essential
at all. If the materials are poor in quality and unsuitable to the
idea of a book; if the proportions detract from the aesthetic effect,
or from the book's practical usefulness, typography can do very
little to save it.</p>

<p>In the last two years the publishers have been increasing trim
sizes without increasing list prices, and at the same time increasing
bulks, instead of reducing them to compensate. What that means
in simple arithmetic is that when a novel is increased from a 7-1/2
inch 12mo to an 8-1/8 inch large 12mo, and the bulk from 1 inch to
1-1/8 inches, it requires a third more cubic inches of paper, a seventh
more square inches of cloth, a sixth more board, etc.&mdash;all for
the same money. It means even softer, less printable, less bindable
paper; cheaper binding materials throughout; sewing in 32's and
other skimping in workmanship. And it means clumsier, uglier,
more perishable books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>While other industries are seeking to make the implements of
living more convenient and more durable and more beautiful, we
are deliberately making books less convenient and less durable
and less beautiful. While other industries are helping to develop
popular taste and anticipating changes in it, we are waiting for
our customers to get mad at us. While we see the masses getting
wise to other frauds of branding and packaging, we still hand our
"intelligent minority" the old fraud of inflated books.</p>

<p>The digest magazines can get millions of readers, though magazines
have always had <em>large</em> pages, but "that's not the book business."
A few of the publishers can sell small books, but "that's all
right for <em>their</em> lists." Booksellers can tell us the public is on to us,
but "<em>their</em> customers aren't typical book buyers." Our friends can
tell us they like to carry books in their pockets, and that they
have no more room on their shelves, or under their beds, but
they're only our crazy friends. Our salesman can tell us he got a
bad order because the book was too thin&mdash;and ah! there we have
the real and only truth.</p>

<p>Publishers of new books blame this practice on the reprints,
but they themselves control much of the offending reprint output.
We allow the cheapest and shoddiest goods to set our styles;
as if Fourteenth Street were to lead our dress industry, and jerry-built
Queens our builders. Publishing is indeed, as we are so often
told, a "different" kind of business!</p>

<p>Most of the books I examined suffered from this inflation. In
most cases the money spent on them would have produced a
sound, handsome, and durable book in a smaller size, and without
small type or crowding. Books printed on proper paper were so
rare that I found myself reluctant to discard the few I found,
however undistinguished in other respects some of them were.
(I felt the same way about the few books with trimmed edges&mdash;but
that is a delicate subject better discussed face to face, and with
weapons, than in a family journal.)</p>

<p>Most of the books suffered also from too much typography.
I think we are all trying desperately to overcome typographically
the handicap of paper and materials. Some of us find that if we
don't do stunts the publisher will think we're not trying. Some of
us are still suffering a little from Rogers-complaint. And some
of us are perhaps just too anxious to express ourselves.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, we seldom have the courage to let a
simple book stay simple. We are very particular about the type<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[Pg 173]</span>
we select, and then we are afraid to use it boldly, and to depend
on the design of the letter for our effects. Books with illustrations,
diagrams, complicated heads, or other special matter, we are apt
to handle well; but when the copy is simple we do insist on using
rules and/or ornament. When we use ornament we are inclined
to have meaningless little units repeated endlessly throughout the
book, instead of a few positive, significant elements, used with
proper restraint.</p>

<p>In many of the books I saw, the design bore no relation to the
subject matter, either in materials, format, or typography, and
these were by no means all from the hands of inexperienced designers.
Many suffered, of course, because good types are not
available for certain problems. None of the composing machines
has a really suitable type for books on contemporary subjects:
the natural and social sciences, architecture and technology, etc.
There should be several such types, comparable to the old numbered
"moderns" and "old styles" but better in design, traditional
in general form but impersonal and mechanized in drawing; and
cut in several weights for different papers. If I may conclude by
quoting again from my last effort in this medium, we are <em>still</em>
"anxiously awaiting the composing-machine companies' arrival
in the Twentieth Century."</p>


<p class="p01"><em>Postscript</em>, 1951:</p>

<p>Re-reading the above complaints, I am saddened to find how
many of them I would repeat today. Many of them, but not all.
The inflated book is becoming rare, but it took a world war to
finish it off. With it we are losing the sloppy rough-cut fore-edge.
"Period" typography is quite dead, but its belated and tortured
passing is no credit to any of us.</p>

<p>We still have too much typography, however; too many self-conscious
tricks, too much un-discipline. And we still lack many
of the types we need. The war may fairly be blamed for disrupting
the programs of the machine people, for a book face takes
years of labor and trial to produce. But where are the new hand-types?</p>

<p>A healthy printing industry needs a prolific type design program.
Creative type-founding stimulates the typographer, and
paves the way for the machine cutting. We need ignore competition
in the foundry field, and all we have is one tired monopoly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[Pg 174]</span>
Perhaps most of us are too polite to point, but let us not think that
we can ignore the foundry situation, and supply the lack of types
with calligraphy. Every creative period in printing history has
produced its own new types. The present period can make no important
contribution without doing the same.</p>

<small>WHAT IS A PRIVATE PRESS?</small></h2>

<p class="p22 center small1">From <cite>Private Presses and Their Books</cite>, by Will Ransom. Copyright 1929 by
R. R. Bowker Co. Reprinted by permission of author and publisher. Corrected and
amended by the author.</p>

<p>Whenever private presses are mentioned, one of two questions
is certain to be heard. The layman asks, "What do you mean, a private
press?" while a collector smiles quizzically and inquires, with gentle
malice, "How do <em>you</em> define a private press?" There have been many
answers and much discussion, but common agreement has not yet fixed
upon a single definite phrase. Perhaps one fascinating element of the
subject is this very uncertainty.</p>

<p>There is really little question about the meaning of "private" in any
connection, with its connotation of complete personal freedom in
thought and expression and exemption from exterior influence or compulsion.
So it is a simple matter to define a private press in those terms.
The usual argument, however, is less concerned with a fundamental
definition than with its interpretation. The uncertainty is about which
of the many presses of past and present shall be considered, from the
collector's viewpoint, private enterprises as distinguished from commercial
ventures. Actually the line of demarcation is so broad and nebulous
that decision must always remain a matter of personal opinion. For a
working basis, the following statements provide the best available
material.</p>

<p>John Martin, in his <cite>Bibliographical Catalogue of Books Privately
Printed</cite> (1834), included certain presses whose productions "were not
intended by the writers for sale, and the circulation of which has been
confined entirely to their friends and connexions or to those who took
an interest in the matter contained in them." The intent is apparent, but
it applies equally to privately printed and private press printing, which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[Pg 176]</span>are different matters. The restriction to "writers" is unfortunate, and
Martin contradicts himself by including at least one press, Strawberry
Hill, many of whose books were offered for public sale. On the other
hand, he omitted many which were clearly within his own terms.</p>

<p>M. Claudin, the French bibliographer, explains at greater length
that a private press is "one set up in a monastery, a palace, a residence,
or a private house, not the office of a printer. In fact it is a press reserved
for personal and not for public use, patronized, held, owned, or hired
for the occasion by a private person at his own house, or by a congregation
in, or close to, their buildings. Whether the copies issued were
merely intended for the use of an ecclesiastical order or to be presented
to high personages, whether they were exposed for sale or reserved for
exchange ... makes no essential difference." That seems to cover the
ground pretty thoroughly.</p>

<p>Alfred W. Pollard, one of the foremost English authorities, says:
"For a press to be private a double qualification seems to be necessary:
the books it prints must not be obtainable by any chance purchaser who
offers a price for them and the owner must print for his own pleasure
and not work for hire for other people." And Falconer Madan, another
noted English bibliographer, condenses his decision into "a press carried
on unofficially by a person or group of persons for his or their private
purposes."</p>

<p>The following paragraph, as originally written, erroneously ascribed
the quotation to John T. Winterich. It should have read: Still
another neatly phrased version occurs in <cite>English Books 1475-1900</cite>,
by Sawyer and Darton: "Perhaps, in the end, the best definition of a
private press is that it is an enterprise conceived, and masterfully and
thoroughly carried out, by a creative artist who (whether or not he likes
to cover some of his expenses by sales) does his work from a sincere
conviction that he is so expressing his own personality."</p>

<p>Except that any book offered for sale may easily come into the hands
of "any chance purchaser" who learns of it, and that "creative artist" is
a severe limitation, the common factor of independent expression is
apparent in all these.</p>

<p>Granting the connotation of "privacy" as an imperative factor, a survey
of impulses and characteristics provides a better understanding of
the matter. Actually, the principal differences of opinion and the major
argument derive from the question of whether or not the productions
of a press are sold or given away. But what difference does that make
if the fundamental impulse and continued purpose prove monetary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[Pg 177]</span>
return to be a minor consideration, a casual effect rather than a desired
result? It is true that many private presses, even some of the greater
ones, continued for longer and more prolifically than they would have
without patronage, but that was because their subscribers liked the result
of what was done in free personal expression. Even the Kelmscott Press
produced an edition for Way and Williams with a Chicago imprint,
but it should be noted that the publishers bought the book and the
book-making of Morris' choice instead of engaging him to carry out
their wishes. So there seems to be sufficient justification for disregarding
the financial element, so long as it is clearly secondary, except to note
that a private press must be free from the necessity of considering that
phase of the matter.</p>

<p>As individual expression chooses many avenues, each with its particular
attraction, the reasons for establishing private presses are numerous
and varied. They have sprung from the dreams and desires of
craftsmen, authors and artists, prophets and dilettantes. Broadly, they
divide into two general classes, one being concerned with literary content
and the other with typographic form, with perhaps a third division
concerned only with enjoying something to play with. The typographic
viewpoint seems to attract popular interest to the greatest extent.</p>

<p>The simplest and perhaps the truest type of private press is that
maintained by one who is, at least by desire, a craftsman and finds a
peculiar joy in handling type, ink, and paper, with sufficient means and
leisure to warrant such an avocation. His literary selection may leave
something to be desired and art may be disregarded or amazingly interpreted,
but he has a good time. As a correspondent recently wrote:
"This small effort shows the difficulties of an amateur both with ink
and with type. But as it is a matter of the mere fun of the thing, rather
than business, I am in that singularly fortunate position of being able
to tell anyone who doesn't like it to go jump in the lake." Another
version of the same spirit was happily expressed by Edwin Roffe (Rochester
Press) in 1861:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw15">
<div class="poetry">
<p><em>I must confess,</em><br />
<em>I love my Press;</em><br />
<em>For when I print,</em><br />
<em>I know no stint,</em><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><em>Of joy.</em></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the other extreme is the author who is entirely or largely concerned
with producing his own writings. He may turn printer by choice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[Pg 178]</span>
or for economy, or may hire a workman, but he must, to qualify as a
private press, maintain the equipment in his own ownership or control.
In this group the personal element is usually the one point of interest,
as the typography is generally a mere means to an end. Somewhere in
this rating may be included the secret presses devoted to political and
religious propaganda in the days when free speech was a hazardous
adventure; also those which, like Middle Hill, were established to preserve
and distribute rare or unique items of information and record.</p>

<p>Then there is the dilettante who dabbles a little in both phases but
performs few of the functions in his own person. His viewpoint is more
nearly that of a publisher, yet insofar as he maintains a press and follows
an individual program he is a member of this goodly company. Horace
Walpole was an excellent example. "Present amusement is all my
object," he said at the start, and no doubt he accomplished that purpose
not only for himself but for many of his friends.</p>

<p>Another distinct approach to private press activity, most familiar because
its results have been more significant and have affected typography
as a whole more emphatically, is from the standpoint of aesthetic or
artistic vision. Men with a fine feeling for beauty have done marvels
with available materials, but the impulse usually includes type design.
"Let's make a new fount of type" voiced the conception of the Kelmscott
Press and the next ten or twelve years saw almost as many types
designed, not all successful but certainly bearing the impress of individual
expression. Even Dr. Daniel, with no assumption of creative
ability, served the cause well by searching out and reviving the Fell
types.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a kind of press which may or may not be considered
private but is certainly not commercial, a press maintained by a school
for educational purposes of one form or another. Rarely do these reach
a collector's attention, since their products are distinctly localized, but
there are instances of significant accomplishment. The notable example
is the Laboratory Press where, under the direction of Porter Garnett,
students of printing learn something of typography in terms of the ideal,
not to mention other cultural by-products. Mr. Garnett's statement may
well be added to the definitions already quoted. "Issuing publications
(for such, in spite of their slenderness, our students' specimens are),
and having no commercial function, the Laboratory Press is, in the
purest sense of the term, a private press; and its purpose being solely
educational, it may be said to be the first private press to be dedicated
exclusively to educational ends." On the sole point of priority the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[Pg 179]</span>
Whitnash and School Presses might be offered in evidence, but no
comparison of purpose can fairly be suggested.</p>

<p>Somewhat in the same spirit is the use of a private press for experimental
work, as proposed by James Guthrie, who has said: "The artist
at the press is, before everything, an explorer. His true mission is to
suggest and demonstrate, not ideas thirty years old, but new ideas,
which may take our friend the fine printer (by easy methods) another
thirty years to see the drift of!" That approach, as well as another stated
intention towards "a gesture of protest and criticism," is of a part with
the purpose animated by vision of new and finer achievement. That
there was feeling of experiment in the first Kelmscott type and book
is a matter of record, as is the fact that subsequent experience and development
have changed the result in some important details.</p>

<p>While these groups serve to distinguish the main differences between
various kinds of private presses, very few individual instances lie within
one classification. Craftsmen have turned to writing, authors to printing,
and dilettantes to both. Some have achieved simultaneous distinction
in type design, writing, and book-making. Such versatility is rare, yet it
is illuminating to note that the outstanding figures, those who have
contributed most of permanent worth to subsequent culture, of which
William Morris is the chief example, are the ones who have combined
the greatest number of elements in their activities.</p>

<p>Out of all these has come something more than individual purpose
and personal endeavor. Though the poorest of them have earned nothing
more than pity or at best a genial tolerance, the significant presses
have contributed richly to the program of typography and to aesthetic
progress in general. Although the story of private presses is no more
than a tiny chapter in the annals of graphic art, although all of them
are but an infinitesimal part of the deluge of printers and printing since
the middle of the fifteenth century, their influence, particularly upon
book design, is strikingly impressive out of all proportion to their size
and number. Verily, they are "the little leaven that leaveneth the whole
lump."</p>

<p>After all is said, the distinguishing quality of a private press is no
less than a matter of spirit, indefinable except by inference. Whatever
decision is made concerning the status of a press, with regard to its being
private or not, must be based upon a recognition of the ideal apparent
in its works, with due consideration for the human elements of its
activities. Freed from the confining strictures of details, a private press
may be defined as the typographic expression of a personal ideal, conceived
in freedom and maintained in independence.</p>

<p class="pc1 small1 center">PRESS MARK, ITS SECOND, BY FREDERIC W. GOUDY. Mr. Ransom was associated with the Village Press during its beginning
months at Park Ridge, Ill., in the Summer of 1903.</p>

<p>P<small>OSTSCRIPT</small>, 1951:</p>

<p>Twenty-four years later the question is still academic. Instead of a
few distinguished private presses there is now a spate of "press books,"
some of which are produced in home privacy, others designed or printed
or published by an outstanding personality, and a few, regrettably, on
the border line of the commercial limited editions racket. But the meaning
of "privacy" remains unchanged and a private press is what it has
always been, a personal activity. I cannot improve on my original
statement.</p>

<p>To fill out the record with some definitions that were unknown or
omitted in the earlier chapter, and to get all of the statements into one
place, we may begin with William Morris's <cite>Note on His Aims in
Founding the Kelmscott Press</cite> (1898): "I began printing books with
the hope of producing some which would have a definite claim to
beauty, while at the same time they should be easy to read and should
not dazzle the eye, or trouble the intellect of the reader by eccentricity
of form in the letters."</p>

<p>C. R. Ashbee, of the Essex House Press, stated in <cite>The Private
Press: A Study in Idealism</cite> (1909): "A private press as we understand
it at the present day in England and America is a Press whose objective
is first of all an aesthetic one, a press that if it is to have real worth
challenges support on a basis of Standard, caters for a limited market
and is not concerned with the question of the Commercial development
of printing by machinery." In 1933 (also twenty-four years later) he
repeated that definition in <cite>The Book-Collector's Quarterly</cite> (No. XI,
p. 72) and added: "That, I think, is as near as we shall get."</p>

<p>For the Doves Press, T. J. Cobden-Sanderson explained his purpose
in the three <cite>Catalogues Raisonné</cite> of 1908, 1911, and 1916, shortened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[Pg 181]</span>
in the last: "... to attack the problem of Typography as presented by
ordinary books in the various forms of Verse, Prose, and Dialogue and,
keeping always in mind the principles laid down in the Book Beautiful,
to attempt its solution by the simple arrangement of the whole Book,
as a whole, with due regard to its parts and to the emphasis of its capital
divisions rather than by the addition &amp; splendour of applied ornament."</p>

<p>Among the commentators and bibliographers, Robert Steele, in <cite>The
Revival of Printing</cite> (1912) makes no attempt at definition, and G. S.
Tomkinson, in his <cite>Select Bibliography of Modern Presses</cite> (1928)
"still seeks the right answers." In the latter book, Bernard H. Newdigate's
introduction contains two statements which indicate the spirit
that informs private presses and in recent years has expanded into more
public book-making: "... a zeal in the pursuit of their art which has
been inspired by something more than mere money-making, and in
many cases by the attainment of a degree of excellence which invests
their work with a peculiar interest for all those who study printing..."
and specifically about operators of private presses who "have printed
their books because they have judged the books worth printing for their
own sakes, or worth printing in some particular way; and it is the particular
way in which each of these printers has sought to give expression
to his conception of how his books should be printed and the way in
which he has overcome the limitations of his type and plant and solved
the several problems which beset the studious printer in every detail of
his work, that give them so much individual interest...."</p>

<p>In later years, we have had noble bibliographies of the Nonesuch,
Grabhorn, and Ashendene Presses, Bruce Rogers' <cite>Paragraphs on Printing</cite>,
and Daniel Berkeley Updike's <cite>Notes on the Merrymount Press</cite>
and <cite>Some Aspects of Printing, Old and New</cite>. All of these are required
reading for collectors of press books, and each represents a personal
viewpoint, but only one defines a private press.</p>

<p>That is the Ashendene <cite>Bibliography</cite>, but one who seeks for a formal
declaration will not find it. The few phrases that can be isolated&mdash;" ...
the absorbing interest of an otherwise busy life...."&mdash;"The Press
was started solely for the sake of the interest and amusement I expected
to derive from it...."&mdash;"... the striving after an ideal...."&mdash;these
casual comments are slender evidence. If, however, the entire Foreword
is read, one discovers just why and how a private press is operated&mdash;"the
letter killeth, but the spirit maketh alive."</p>

and The Pleasure of Small Books</small></em></h2>

<p class="p22 center small1">From the Centaur announcement booklet, Lanston Monotype Corporation,

<p>Printers, as a class, like all other craftsmen, can only thrive
by supplying their customers with what they want at prices
which they are willing to pay. Here and there an exceptionally
gifted and courageous craftsman may rely on being able to obtain
a better price for better work, and be rewarded for his confidence,
but success will always depend not only on himself but
also on two external factors over which he has very little control;
the existence of enough customers, or potential customers, able
to recognise better work than that which they have been getting,
and the ability and willingness of these customers to pay a higher
price for it as long as a higher price is necessary for its production.
But occasionally the discriminating customer (or potential customer)
may not find a master-craftsman able and willing to do
for him what he wants, and if so, if he cares enough about it to be
an enterprising amateur, he starts a press of his own to print the
books he wants as he thinks they ought to be printed. Very often
he fails; almost always he finds that he must engage at least one
skilled journeyman to help him through. But occasionally he succeeds,
and when he succeeds he brings new life into the craft of
printing.</p>

<p>Definitions of what constitutes an "amateur" have always
proved difficult. The two characteristics of the class of which I
am thinking are that they have been readers and lovers of books
before they have become printers and that they will not knowingly
print any book badly for the sake of making a profit off it.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[Pg 183]</span>As a rule they will only print the books they like, and they will
print them according to their own standards. That some of them
have made a good living by their work, does not alter their status.</p>

<p>In the early days of printing amateurs abounded, but not at the
very first. When printing was invented it was applied first of all
to multiplying a few much-used Latin grammars and calendars
for which there was a large and steady sale, because the production
of manuscript copies had been too slow and too expensive.
These early efforts, which have come down to us mainly in fragments
found in binding, are rude and ugly enough. There is no
evidence of any effort to make them beautiful for the sake of
making them beautiful, and there was no need to do so. Fifteenth-century
schoolmasters did not cosset their pupils with pretty
school-books; they beat them. Their standard in printing was
strictly utilitarian. But when the adventure was once undertaken,
whether it was by Gutenberg, or by Fust and Schöffer, of printing
large Bibles for use in church, there was at once admitted a
standard of dignity, and this the Church for centuries did more
than any other body to maintain. Furthermore when the goldsmith
Fust and the scribe Peter Schöffer, greatly daring, set
themselves to produce psalters for use in choir which, by red
printing and by large and small capitals in red and blue, should
rival the beauty of the hand-written and hand-painted psalters
then in use, to the dignity of the first Bibles there was added
beauty and charm, and in a few years bookmen all over Europe
were eager to apply the new craft to multiplying the books in
which they were specially interested. A few secular highbrows
stood aloof. As some old ladies still drive out in their carriage and
pair (a very pleasant and dignified way of getting about) and abjure
motor-cars, so there were a few great bookmen who clung
to manuscripts and would not have a printed book in their libraries.
In the same way for some twenty years bishops looked
askance at presses and types, and it was not until 1474 that a
printed missal was placed upon an altar, and not until 1479 that
more than two editions were printed in any year, or anywhere
outside Italy. But when Milan and Rome had continued to set the
example, German bishops were content to follow it, and when
they decided to print they found a vigorous way of maintaining
a high standard. They commissioned the best printer they could
get to do the work; they allowed him to charge an agreed price<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[Pg 184]</span>
for it, and they obliged every Church in their province or diocese
to provide itself with a copy before a specified date.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>In France in several instances a Bishop, or the Canons of a
Cathedral, arranged with a printer to come to the Cathedral town
and print a missal or breviary under their supervision. These good
men were perhaps rather amateur publishers than amateur printers
working private presses with a hired man to do the heavy
work. But if we choose to think of them only as customers, they
were customers who knew what they wanted and brought the
printer under their roof as the best means of seeing that they got it.</p>

<p>As regards the printing of secular books in the fifteenth century,
since the craft was a new one, it was necessarily run in the
first instance by men who had been brought up in other occupations.
In this sense nearly every native printer outside Germany
was an amateur. At the outset the newcomers were largely clerks
in minor orders and professional scribes; but merchants, professors
and men of letters generally were attracted to the new
craft, many of them doubtless only to make money, others to
print books in which they were specially interested. Even more
than in the case of the bishops or canons who commissioned missals
and breviaries, we must think of this motley crowd of recruits
rather as amateur publishers than amateur printers. It may be
doubted whether even Caxton (who was by trade a mercer) in
all his fifteen years in the business, set up the equivalent of one of
his small folios with his own hands. He started his press because
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[Pg 185]</span>he wanted to get his books into print as the easiest way of circulating
them; but there are no signs that he took any special
interest in fine printing for its own sake, or took any joy in producing
a handsome book. His standards were those of a competent
but unenterprising scribe, who only wanted to set his words down
accurately on the page so that they could be easily read. The master
printers all over the Continent of Europe, when they had the
courage to stand out against the pressure to cut prices or increase
profits by using cheaper and cheaper paper, and crowding more
on to it, were doing much better work than Caxton, and when
they found customers who encouraged them to do their best,
their work altogether outclassed his.</p>


<p>When we turn to the scholar-printers of the sixteenth century
I think it would be hard to deny the claim of Aldus and the Estiennes
to a disinterested love of good printing, as well as a desire
to get the books in which they were interested into print. It is
true that the rich scholars of Italy and France were used to a high
standard of excellence in the books, manuscript or printed, which
they put on their shelves, but it is to the credit of Aldus and the
Estiennes and Simon Colines and Geoffroy Tory that they
catered also for the needs of less wealthy scholars, not by cheapening
paper or crowding more old types on a page, but by designing,
or causing to be designed, new fonts, with which they
could print more economically without loss of beauty. Moreover,
more especially at Lyons, the new ideals of compact printing,
of the small book beautiful, were applied to printing not only in
Greek and Latin, but in the vernacular, and these sixteenth century
models can still be imitated without archaism or ostentation,
which, when fifteenth century masterpieces are followed,
are often difficult to avoid.</p>

<p>"A penny, I trow, is enough for books," said one of Robert
Copland's customers to him, somewhere about 1530, and the spirit
of that remark haunted the vernacular English book trade for
nearly a century and a half. Amid all the outpouring of the wonderful
Elizabethan and Jacobean literature, though no printing
was allowed in the provinces except at Oxford and Cambridge,
there was not a sufficient demand for books in all England to provide
work for more than about five and twenty master printers
many of whom had only a single press, with a couple of journeymen
and an apprentice. The Privy Council was always trying to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[Pg 186]</span>
keep down the number, both of printers and presses, and its action
in so doing is usually represented as solely dictated by the
fear of their being employed in producing seditious or schismatic
pamphlets. No doubt this fear was the main cause of the Council's
action. But if there had been enough lawful work for twice
as many printers and presses, the number might have been doubled
with no increase of risk. The risk lay solely in the fact that a
man who owned and could use a press, if he could not get enough
lawful work to give him a living, might be tempted to take secret
work. Unless they were desperate, men would not risk hanging
to earn a few shillings, or a few pounds, but there is ample evidence
that in Shakespeare's day some of the small master printers
really were desperate, and it was only natural that they should do
bad work&mdash;as indeed they did. All over Europe printing at the
beginning of the seventeenth century was bad; in England it was
very bad indeed.</p>

<p>During the second half of the seventeenth century and the
whole of the eighteenth, the wealth of England steadily increased,
and with its wealth the standard of education. There was
a much greater demand for books, and though printing was permitted
after 1693 in the provinces without restrictions, there was
clearly more work to do in London. Printing became neat, and
on occasion elaborate, and throughout the eighteenth century,
both in England and Scotland, there were constant experiments
and efforts to improve it, to which full justice has not yet been
done. Among these efforts to improve it there is no reason to include
Horace Walpole's private press at Strawberry Hill, or any
of the other private presses which, possibly in imitation of his
example, subsequently sprang up, except perhaps that at Lee
Priory. The Strawberry Hill books were handsomely printed
according to the taste of the day, but they showed no originality,
such as was displayed by Baskerville or even the Foulises, and they
certainly started no style. The other private presses of the eighteenth
and early nineteenth centuries were purely literary in their
aims, and many of the books produced at them are below the
average good commercial work of the day.</p>

<p>In the middle of the nineteenth century the great spread of
education caused a demand for very cheap books, both for amusement
and instruction, which led to some lowering of standard.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[Pg 187]</span>
More dangerous still were the very gaudy ideals of decorative
work which found favour during the era inaugurated by the
Great Exhibition of 1851. There was an epidemic of bad taste
among book buyers and publishers, and therefore printers responded
to it, as they always will, whether gladly or reluctantly,
respond to any popular demand which brings grist to their mill.
Meanwhile much quite good work was being done by the Chiswick
Press and other firms, but the influence of the amateur on
the professional printing of that period is not much in evidence,
either for good or for evil.</p>

<p>The Daniel Press, worked as an amusement by the Rev. C. H.
O. Daniel, Provost of Worcester College, Oxford, for a good
many years, beginning about 1874, seems to me one of the best
examples of a really amateur press that can be adduced. The interest
of its books is mainly literary, but it is also typographical,
and though the performance is usually slight, and even thin, Dr.
Daniel showed real <em>flair</em> in his revival of the old Fell types, his
uses of italics, and the happy knack with which the work was put
on the page. I think that Dr. Daniel's influence may possibly be
traced, though only quite slightly, in some of the pretty books
(often a little spoilt by the weakness of the ink) published by
Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Co., in the eighties, most of them printed
by Messrs. Ballantyne. If this is true, it is so much more to Dr.
Daniel's credit.</p>

<p>We come now to the movement of which William Morris was
the leader, which placed to the credit of English typography
some of the finest books the world has ever seen. Morris must be
classed as an amateur, and his press as a private press, because he
printed to please himself, and no offer of money, however great,
would have induced him to print anything he really disliked. We
must not, however, allow the private income which enabled Morris
to carry out his ideas without worrying over cash-returns, or
the fact that he sold most of his books by means of circulars from
a private house instead of over a counter, or any other consideration,
to blind us to the fact that he was one of the world's greatest
craftsmen, and certainly, if we consider his versatility, his sureness
of touch and his imagination, the finest that the British Isles
have ever produced. If he had had the largest printing house in
London, and had printed the Kelmscott books in a special depart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[Pg 188]</span>ment
of it to advertise the rest, it could not have made him more
of a craftsman than he was. He stands in a very real sense alone
by virtue of his unique and splendid personality.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i188" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_188.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>Admiration for Morris led to the setting up of several private
or amateur presses, which did excellent work in his spirit: notably
the Doves Press, conducted at first by Mr. Cobden-Sanderson, an
ex-barrister, who had produced some real masterpieces as a bookbinder,
and Mr. Emery Walker, the photo-engraver, who had
ever been ready to help anyone trying to promote good printing;
afterwards by Mr. Cobden-Sanderson alone. There was also the
Ashendene Press of Mr. St. John Hornby, one of the partners
in Messrs. W. H. Smith &amp; Son, who, I fancy, has done rather
more of the work with his own hands than most other private
printers. Robert Proctor's Greek type, again, was brought into existence
by love of Morris, but Proctor, like Messrs. Ricketts and
Shannon, who were responsible for the Vale Press books, had no
press of his own.</p>

<p>The beauty of all these books reinforced the influence of the
Kelmscott Press ones, by proving that what Morris had done on
his own lines could be done by lesser men with the variations suggested
by their individual tastes. They reinforced also the proof
which Morris had given, that so long as it is regarded as a hobby
(or in a commercial house as an advertisement) the production of
really fine specimens of printing is not an impossibly expensive
one. Morris made no profit from the Kelmscott books as a pub<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[Pg 189]</span>lisher;
could allot himself no payment for all the magnificent
decorative work which he put into them with his own hands. He
got nothing from his venture save the joy of achievement and
pleasure of giving copies to his friends. But he proved the existence
of a public willing to pay for the cost of print and paper,
even when both print and paper were the best which money
could buy; and I believe that most venturers in the same field
have been supported to about the same extent. From our present
point of view, this is one of the most important results which
Morris achieved. The direct influence of his work on men like
Mr. Updike and Mr. Bruce Rogers can only be reckoned very
slight. But if the Kelmscott books had not made the success they
did, neither Mr. Updike nor Mr. Bruce Rogers would have been
given his chance, and to make it possible for younger men to get
their chance is one of the finest things a master craftsman can do.</p>

<p>Private presses have multiplied greatly in the last thirty years,
and some of them have done fine work. But the influence which
they are exercising on the commercial printing of the present day
is not in any way comparable to that which the Kelmscott and
Doves books exercised a generation ago. There is no virtue in a
book being printed in a small edition or in a private house, and
no virtue in producing endless specimens of printing rather than
books. Mr. Meynell and the Nonesuch Press (whose achievements
I should admire much more joyously if it had not been
called a "press") have shown what a diversity of interesting work
can be obtained from commercial printers by a man who has
good taste and knows how to get what he wants. When fine work
can be obtained in this way private presses seem of little use save
as an amusement to their owners. But no one is as yet making full
use of the revolution (a much greater revolution than that inaugurated
by the Aldine italics) which the "Monotype" machine
has effected in modern printing just at the moment when (owing
to the economic conditions, compositors having at last secured a
fair wage) it was most needed. Thanks to the wonderful facility
with which small types can now be cut and the greater quickness
of machine-setting there is now only one obstacle to a new triumph
of the Small Book Beautiful; and that is the obsession of
the paymaster, the Customer, that it is unreasonable to expect
him to pay anything approaching the same price for compact
books in small clear type with no needless expanse of blank paper
around the type page, as for the same number of words printed
in larger type and with much more blank paper. The obsession is
fostered by the fact that the reprints of popular books which
have passed out of copyright and which often are produced in
very pretty forms, are sold in large quantities at small prices, because
no author has to make a livelihood out of them. But if a
book does not appeal to a large public and yet has to earn money
for its author it cannot be sold at a low price, and it is childish for
the customer to insist that this fact should be concealed from him
by books being made needlessly large in order that he may persuade
himself that he is still getting plenty for his money. Publishers
and Printers and Authors should unite to educate their
paymaster the Customer on this point, and it is much to their
interest to do so, for the book space which is now occupied by a
couple of hundred volumes might easily hold two or three times
as many if all books were printed with pleasant compactness. If
an Amateur would arise who would help to train Customers to
pay high prices for beautiful compact books he would be doing
good service. At present most of the finely printed books are
needlessly and inconveniently large.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">[33]</a> The story of Bible-printing in England runs on very much the same lines.
As soon as it was decided that English Bibles were to be placed in all churches,
the printers were chosen, the price was fixed and every Parish was ordered to
supply itself with a copy. From that day to this, with only a very partial
exception for a few years under Queen Elizabeth, the printing of the plain
text of the Bible has been a monopoly in England. Since the seventeenth
century it has been kept absolutely in the hands of the King's Printers and
the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. From about 1770 onwards various
provincial printers tried to circumvent this monopoly by printing Bibles with
only a nominal amount of commentary, but hardly any of them found it worth
while to issue a second edition. The monopolists knew that to maintain their
rights in the nineteenth century, which made unrestricted competition into a
fetish, they must give good value to buyers, ensure good workmanship, and
give their workmen no ground for complaint. They have fulfilled all three
conditions, and as a result we still have a Bible Trust in England, which is a
Trust in the true meaning of the word, because it is worked in the interest
of everyone concerned.</p></div></div>

<small>SOME COLLECTORS READ</small></h2>

<p class="center p22 small1">This essay appeared originally in <cite>The Colophon</cite>, Part IV, 1930. It was revised and
retitled The Personal Element for inclusion in <cite>The Nonesuch Century</cite>, 1936, from which
it is here reprinted.</p>

<p>It wouldn't be easy to imagine an idea, a policy
and a business more "personal" than our Nonesuch has been.
This is my excuse for the personal (worse, the first-personal)
character of these ensuing notes.</p>

<p>Nonesuch was started by three of us in the close quarters of a basement
room (two of the three became husband and wife); at our
busiest and most successful we have never had an office staff of more
than three, usually our friends as well as our associates; we later lived
above and in our office; we have been responsible ourselves not only
for every decision of policy of what to publish and not to publish
but also for every piece of printing, of make-up, of advertising; for
jackets, catalogues, specimen pages and a vast deal of miscellaneous
editing. And, more than anything else, it is our own taste which has
determined our choice of books and choice of styles. In short everything
(except typing and account-adding in later days) has been done
by Vera Meynell or David Garnett or me.</p>

<p>When I set myself to the making of these notes I thought I should
only have to remember, not to reconstruct. I had by heart all that was
worth knowing about the beginnings of the Nonesuch in itself. But
for its remoter beginnings in myself I found that I had in fact to go
back to my childhood.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[Pg 192]</span></p>
<p>What induced this revision of my opinion was a phrase (quoted
in my brother Everard's "Life" of Francis Thompson) from a letter
of my mother's. "Please return" she had written to Thompson, "the
revise proofs sixteen pages at a time."</p>

<p>First of all (said I to myself) I am the son of a mother who was not
only a poet but who knew also that page proofs have to be dealt with
in units of sixteen. Yes, and that was only a trifle of the family's
knowledge. I have often seen my mother unflinchingly cut a treasurable
phrase in one of her essays so that it should end to the line or
paragraph of the printer's prescription; and correct a proof so that a
word deleted here would be promptly balanced by an added word
there to save the over-running of the corrected lines. Where did she
learn this tenderness towards my craft? But from my father, of course.</p>

<p>And then I realised that, if he likes it or not, the Nonesuch Press
is really my father's grand-son. In establishing it I was doing no more
than reverting to type.</p>

<p>There was of course the literary background, the great names and
exciting personalities of the writers who were my parents' friends.
There was George Meredith whose limping descent of the staircase
I can just, and whose yearly tip of a pound at Christmas I can very
easily, remember. There was the silver teapot which I never carried
to be replenished without remembering my father's solemn sanctification
of it: "Robert Browning has taken his tea from this." There was
W. B. Yeats standing owl-like at the door blinking to discover my
mother through the smoke emitted from the Egyptian cigarettes which
I had lately been sent at top speed to buy, my father sometimes going
twice through his pockets before he assembled the necessary tenpence
halfpenny. (Tenpence halfpenny was also the price of a box of soldiers,
and once I thought of buying soldiers instead of cigarettes and
running away from home.) There was Francis Thompson, "The
Poet" as we children always called him, fragile, mannered, and complaining
of the weather or of the quality of our food. Much later I
remember Jack Squire discussing the plans for the first <cite>London Mercury</cite>;
and Hilaire Belloc brought by Wilfrid Blunt because of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[Pg 193]</span>
father's "discovery" of his first writing in the <cite>Morning Post</cite>. I don't
remember Stevenson or Patmore; but framed holographs of <cite>In the
Highlands</cite> and <cite>The Toys</cite> were set between the gold Japanese embroideries
which surrounded the sitting room. This literary "atmosphere"
was more continuously and intensively itself than anything I know
today&mdash;even in psycho-analytic or Communist circles. "Does he
write? Then do bring him." "Is he a Thompsonian? Of course he
must come."</p>

<p>Every Sunday afternoon and evening my parents were "at home."
There was endless poetry-reading, endless "literary talk" by my
mother's devoted admirers. No, not endless. There were two signals
for their departure. The first gong, so to speak, was the arrival of the
hot blackcurrant jam drink. The second was my father unbuttoning,
almost unostentatiously, the top button of his boots.</p>

<p>But all this was literature, not letters, and letters was after all the
chief occupation of the house. A literary hot-house should have produced
in me, very nearly did produce, an over-sensitive literary
plant. And sure enough I wrote poetry, with three of my sisters and
one of my brothers. (George Moore in one of the "Hail and Farewell"
volumes has a disconcerting fancy of the young Meynells assembling
for their verse-writing hour once a week.) But letters made me into
a printer.</p>

<p>In a play about Francis Thompson which was lately produced
my father had necessarily to be represented. He objected to his portrayal
under his own name, and he was therefore made to appear as
John Oldcastle, his writing-name before I was born. In one scene
he was shown sitting in the office of the paper which he edited,
<cite>Merry England</cite>. He struck the bell twice for his sub-editor, once for
his office boy, three times for his secretary. There was indeed such a
magazine. But there was never an office, never a secretary, never a
sub-editor, never an office boy. The whole work was done by my
mother and father and amateur helpers on and about the library
table. If I was allowed in the room on press-days the bargain was
that I was to sit under the table. Mostly this was fun. I learned a lot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[Pg 194]</span>
about the leg-fidgets of writers. And "under the table" became my
own kingdom, from which I could at the age of seven declaim without
embarrassment Gray's "Elegy" to the Sunday night supper guests.
But one memory survives which still carries horror with it&mdash;the memory
of my mother suddenly going down on her knees, down to my
level, and burying her face in her hands. She had just been told, in
the midst of proof-correcting, of the death of Coventry Patmore.</p>

<p>"The Poet" was one of the helpers&mdash;a feared helper. He would
wish to engage all the rest in argument as to the desirability of this or
that paragraph. On one occasion, J. L. Garvin, who could disturb
by his brilliant relevance almost as much as Thompson by his dull
irrelevance, made an unexpected call. Proofs were already overdue.
By a masterly manoeuvre "the poet" was sent to entertain him. Garvin,
the liveliest talker of our day, was overwhelmed by Thompson's
discussion of the relative merits of Lyons and A.B.C. tea shops. He
sat mumchance an afternoon through. Thompson reported: "Never
have I known Garvin so brilliant."</p>

<p><cite>Merry England</cite> was a monthly, but its crises were not less acute for
that. You can put off so easily until too late what has to be done only
once a month. But <cite>The Weekly Register</cite>, which was also my father's
property, and which was written almost wholly by himself and my
mother, was a weekly. The correction of proofs was a diurnal occupation
with Thursdays as the grand climax. It was printed by the
Westminster Press; and here, too, my father was the begetter of my
trade. For he was part-owner of the Westminster Press and helped to
establish with it a style of typography and a care for detail in printing
which were far ahead of the run of commercial presses.</p>

<p>When he was over fifty my father added the last segment to the
circle. Magazine proprietor, editor, writer, printer, he now became
book publisher, as managing director of Burn &amp; Oates. He transferred
from John Lane Francis Thompson's books and my mother's,
and he gave me my first job. He gave me also my first lesson in detail.
<cite>The Collected Works of Francis Thompson</cite> were issued by Burns &amp;
Oates a few months after I had joined the firm, and I was allowed to
have a hand in designing the edition. When it was printed my father
discovered that several commas had broken away from the ends of
lines and that a number of the kerns or top loops of the letter "f" had
been broken. Day after day piles of the imperfect volumes were
massed in his flat, which was immediately above the office. We had
a sort of fire-bucket drill. One of my sisters would find the page, my
father would dab in the comma, I would do the blotting and another
sister would restack the books. Some scores of thousands of pen
corrections were thus made. I don't think my father would have
trusted any one of us to do the actual pen work. He leant back, he
quizzed, he admired after every stroke.</p>

<p>In 1913, pursuing a common typographical errand, I chanced to
meet Stanley Morison, who had just emerged from a bank and was
anxious to concern himself with book-production, and he joined
forces with me at Burns &amp; Oates. A year later as a personal venture
I purchased a hand press, which I kept in my dining room; and my
next step was to persuade the delegates of the Oxford University
Press to let me use some of their seventeenth century Fell types. They
were very obliging, and they let me have what I wanted, charged me
for it as if it were sold, but very properly kept the legal title to it, so
that if I were to misuse this cherished type they could at any time call
upon me to surrender it. I still have these Fell types in my possession.
"The Romney Street Press," since I lived in that street, was my new
"style," and I issued a prospectus, which I regard now with mixed
feelings of shame and admiration at my audacity; for if ever there was
a gold-brick prospectus this was one! Here it is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Romney Street Press at 67 Romney Street, Westminster,
has been set up for the better and unaffected production of Books,
&amp; Pamphlets, &amp; single sheets of poetry. The type of the Press (used
for this prospectus) is the finest of the series imported from Holland
in about 1660 by Bishop Fell for the Oxford University Press, by
whose courtesy it is now used. The editions of the Romney Street
Press will be limited to a maximum of fifty copies. The preliminary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[Pg 197]</span>
costs of equipment amount to £40, &amp; Francis Meynell, the Director
of the Press, invites subscriptions to cover this amount. Subscribers
will have first call upon the publications of the Press at cost price,
upon the amount of their subscription. The first publications will
be Seven Poems by Alice Meynell, written since the issue of the
Collected Poems. There will follow Mary Cary, the meditations,
occasional poems and spiritual diary of the wife of a Cromwellian
captain, now first published, from her MS. note-book; &amp; Love in
Dian's Lap, by Francis Thompson. But the process of production
will be slow. Suggestions for other books, particularly of 17th century
reference, will be welcome. <small>APRIL</small> 1915."</p></div>

<p>I may say at once that the only two books which I issued (<cite>Ten
Poems by Alice Meynell</cite>, and <cite>The Diary of Mary Cary</cite>) were, with a
good deal of difficulty, disposed of&mdash;yes, the whole of the fifty copies;
but there were no general subscriptions to the Press, not one, and the
cost of equipment, forty pounds, bore heavily upon me. Perhaps
because of this, perhaps because my dining room was my workshop,
and printer's ink was apt to get into the soup, I discontinued the
venture&mdash;which in any case (since I had no technical assistance and
very little competence myself) was decidedly irksome.</p>

<p>Meantime decisive things had happened to me. I had met George
Lansbury, inspiration of my politics, and I had met Bruce Rogers,
inspiration of all eager typographers. For the next five years I worked
in close association with George Lansbury. (I suppose that he has
lately become one of the most generally loved men in England. To
anyone who has known him in times of deep stress as intimately as
I have that cannot be surprising. There is no qualification in my
admiration and affection.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>) In him I found a most ready support for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[Pg 198]</span>my "propaganda" view of good printing and good craftsmanship of
any kind. Lansbury secured the financial support which made it
possible for me to start the Pelican Press. I think the Pelican was a
pioneer in the policy of having very few types but all of them of good
design. We set advertisements for commerce, which was in those days
something of an innovation; and we printed political pamphlets in
the Minority Labour interest. These pamphlets are odd to look at
now. The slogan of "fitness for purpose" had not yet informed us. A
report of the great meetings which we held at the Albert Hall after
the first Russian revolution was designed with the mannered elegance
which would have suited better an essay by Walter Pater. And I
remember myself writing a double-page political manifesto for the
<cite>Weekly Herald</cite>, calling upon the proletariat to rise and end the war,
which was set in Cloister Old Face with a seventeenth century
flower border and sixteenth century initials.... I set up with elegance
what must be the rarest of Siegfried Sassoon first editions. I
myself have no copy. Bertrand Russell brought him to see me when
Sassoon had decided to refuse to go back to the war, and I made
into a leaflet his letter of explanation to his Commanding Officer.
I am now astonished at what we published without prosecution.
Now it would be "seditious propaganda." I can only put it down to
the innocent elegance of typography!</p>

<p>Soon after the war I began making proposals from the Pelican
Press to various publishers. Would they allow me to print for them
this that and the other book in a "really nice" edition? I pointed out
that if they were in fact wrecked upon the conventional desert island
and wished to take with them the conventional choice of two books,
Shakespeare and the Bible, they would not find a current edition of
either fit for a tasteful shipwreck. But my arguments were fruitless&mdash;except
of a plan for myself. Why shouldn't I do what I wanted them
to do? Why wait on them? So I began to hanker after the as yet
unnamed, unmanned and unfinanced Nonesuch Press. The next
step was to bind David Garnett and Vera Mendel to the adventure.</p>

<p>David Garnett's family history, like my own, is full of literature.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[Pg 199]</span>
He is the son of two writers and the grandson of a third. He too, after
a brief excursion into the Natural Sciences, reverted to type, opened
a book-shop (with Francis Birrell), wrote his first novel and, in the
same year, lent both the cellar of his book-shop and the assistance of
his critical and book-learned mind to our new venture. He too
"liked" books. He could, I mean, enjoy the feel of a book, its weight,
shape, edges, the synthesis of sensitive things which is represented by
that most insensitive word "format."</p>

<p>Vera Mendel was the useful necessary incubator for our schemes.
She provided our small capital and she did the routine work. She
was also our fearless critic-in-chief. The things she stopped us doing!
She, too, developed in me the sense which David Garnett already
shared with her&mdash;the sense of responsibility about texts. And she put
sobriety whenever she could into my lush "blurbs." Her flexibility of
mind made our work, too, flexible. She translated Toller's first play,
which was among our earliest books; and shared with me the editing
of <cite>The Week-End Book</cite>. For the first eighteen months, while I was
working full time at the Pelican Press and David Garnett at his
book-shop, and before we felt justified in employing as much as an
office girl, she did everything, from editing to stamp-licking, that I
could not steal time to do.</p>

<p>This about ourselves. Whence our corporate name? We began
by looking not for a name, but for a device; and we found in a
tapestry surviving from Nonesuch Palace the elements which Stephen
Gooden made into our first "mark." In adapting the device, we took
also the name; and I silenced an early objection that it was too boastful
by pointing out that Nonesuch means "nonpareil" and so had
an esoteric meaning. For nonpareil is the name of a very small and
very humble size of type. Nonesuch was chosen, then, in a spirit of
mixed hope and humility. Ralph Hodgson, the poet, who was interested
in my enterprise, was most anxious that I should call it the
Pound Press. (He had lately seen and admired my father's seventeenth-century
farmhouse, which has in front of it a delightful yard
or "pound.") Every book, he urged, warming to his subject, should
weigh a pound and cost a pound! After some intensive correspondence
his enthusiasm was routed, and the Nonesuch Press came into
being.</p>

<p>So there we were, in 1923, in our cellar under Birrell &amp; Garnett's
book-shop, book-enthusiasts, amateurs in the literal, though not, I
hope, the derogatory sense of the word, tackling the donkey work of
book production and the mule work of book distribution.</p>

<p>For nearly two years we continued in the half light of our limited
premises, producing illuminating works in limited editions, and
varying the daily task with such occasional diversions as "invoice
bees"&mdash;parties to which our friends were bidden in order to help us
between drinks with the task of writing our invoices, "statements,"
et caetera.</p>

<p>It is scarcely worth recording the vicissitudes of those underground
activities. Only when we tried to stop an ever-rising tide of Congreves&mdash;which,
as with breaking back I eagerly unloaded the volumes
from the lorries, narrowly escaping immuring V.M. in that
unhistoric cellar for good&mdash;only then did we wonder whether, for
purposes of self-preservation, the Press might not have to expand.
(Indeed, one wall did bulge alarmingly.) Happily, part of the edition
of Congreve got lost in Devonshire.... The lorries which were carrying
the bound books from the printers at Plymouth broke down
before we did.</p>

<p>I myself travelled the first books, being received with varying
degrees of courtesy by the book-sellers. Of those who were civil some
were encouraging, some politely discouraging. When, very soon, we
were obliged to "ration" orders, these were rewarded and persuaded,
and the discourteous received no more than their small deserts.</p>

<p>We meant to have fun with our business and fun we have had.
Even when it had outgrown its puppyhood we continued to button-hole
our customers and sell them not only our goods but our tastes
and our views. Let me anticipate for a moment and quote a sample
from the opening paragraph of our 1929 catalogue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[Pg 202]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In these days of literary censorship exercised by Sir Archibald
Bodkin (of Savidge case fame), Sir William Joynson-Hicks and a
Detective-Inspector of Scotland Yard, no publisher can be positive
in his announcement that he will issue such and such a book.
Chaucer? Fie, his language is coarse. Plato? The less said about
Socrates and his young friends, <em>if</em> you please, the better. Shakespeare?
He will perhaps pass unchallenged, for Lamb's Tales doubtless
exhausted the censors' interest in this prurient author. Farquhar,
Don Quixote even&mdash;these too may corrupt the corrupt, which is
the current legal test of obscenity. With a propitiatory bow to Sir
Archibald and to the potent and anonymous Detective-Inspector
(the unlamented Home Secretary gets no more than a distant nod),
we therefore give to this list of announcements the precautionary
title, 'Bodkin Permitting.'"</p></div>

<p>But this jape, and others, were part of a serious and deliberate
policy. From the beginning we had a plan and hoped to have a
public. In the words of our first (1923) catalogue, we intended to
make books "for those among collectors who also use books for
reading." We intended to choose our books to suit our tastes, not
the imputed taste of a hypothetical public.</p>

<p>Not that we felt ego-centric and exclusive about it, like the Californian
millionaire who, I am told, caused a Shakespeare to be
printed to suit his own taste and his own library&mdash;an edition of one
copy. We have made now over a hundred editions to suit our own
personal requirements&mdash;the author we wanted, the text we wanted,
the format we wanted, the decorations we wanted. And if there had
been no other profit from the Press, this shelf of my library would
have seemed in itself a sufficient recompense for my share of the
work. But fortunately, many other people also wanted these books.
For our taste proved to be a normal contemporary taste. We did not
create the vogue for Donne, for instance&mdash;we were ourselves part
of that general tendency which has in these days found him afresh.</p>

<p>My previous experience in printing had shown me quite clearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[Pg 203]</span>
that, in order to avoid monotony and to produce desirable editions
at a reasonable cost, one must intelligently exploit the best mechanical
equipment and the highest technical skill available. Today there
is more fine typographical material to be had than even the largest
printing house in the country could possess; and the various commercial
presses have developed technical skill and variety along
various lines. There was therefore no good reason, we thought, for
a new "private press" in the old style, arrogantly self-contained, and
with but one type and obsolete "hand" machinery.</p>

<p>Our stock-in-trade has been the theory that mechanical means
could be made to serve fine ends; that the machine in printing was
a controllable tool. Therefore we set out to be mobilisers of other
people's resources; to be designers, specifiers, rather than manufacturers;
architects of books rather than builders.</p>

<p>The propriety of our use of the word "Press" was called in question
by Arnold Bennett and others. Pedantically it may be wrong; by the
spirit it is nearly right. There is no exact word for our function,
which was new. Nor for my own part in that function. When I have
wanted to "sign" a book, at first I wrote "Typography by." But
typography is only a quarter of my battle, and that phrase puts undue
emphasis on one department, one only, of a job the essence of which
is that it is manifold. A number of books I signed F. M. <em>Finx</em>. But
"finxit" means "fashioned," and so "made," rather than "designed."
I also used the phrase "under the care of," but this is vague and inaccurate,
suggesting merely the oversight of someone else's designs.
Perhaps "This book was planned by" is the least inaccurate formula,
though this again leaves out the whole business of overseeing. Overseeing
is no purely typographical matter. It means the planning and
coordinating of the whole book&mdash;text, editor, and artist, as well as
paper-maker, printer and binder. In fact, it involves an editorial as
well as a typographical attitude.</p>

<p>Foulk Grevill writing of the posthumous edition of Sidney's
<cite>Arcadia</cite> said "This requyres the care of his friends, not to amend (for
I think that falls within the reach of no man living) but only to see
to the paper, and other common errors of mercenary printing." My
own interest and ambition in founding the Nonesuch was to see to
the paper and other common errors of mercenary printing; but D. G.
and V. M. aspired to tackle the question of amendments as well.
From our fourth book onwards that policy has governed all our
major publications. When, as sometimes happens, a text needs no
more editing: when it is adequately and accurately "established,"
there is still the quasi-editorial function of the illustrator. He may,
he should, become in his designs more than a decorator; he should,
I believe, become a significant <em>commentator</em>. "Kauffer on Burton" is,
for example, how I would describe the drawings for our edition of
<cite>The Anatomy</cite>.</p>

<p>Our books were published in "limited editions" because we had
to rope in the collector as well as the reader and student. We have
found that it was necessary to impose another sort of limit on our
output&mdash;a limit to the number of titles we could conveniently and
properly publish in a given time. We came to the conclusion that
eight books a year was about as much as we could manage if every
detail was to be our personal concern and if all were to be freshly
designed. The making of our books in a great variety of styles was
an early principle, firmly held to. I did not want people to be able to
say at the first sight of our books, "Oh yes, that must be a Nonesuch
book." I wanted them to say, "That's not a bad looking book," and
then to find that it was ours. My calculation&mdash;it was a calculation,
not a programme&mdash;proved surprisingly right. Our first hundred
books have taken us twelve years to make.</p>

<p>Our friends have been our editors; and our editors have been our
friends. We have had the most valuable suggestions for books, and
the most valuable criticism of details of production even, from them.
I have seldom "passed" a binding, for example, without asking
Geoffrey Keynes's opinion of it. His well-wishing has been of extraordinary
value to us, apart from the many editions which he has
himself admirably edited for the Nonesuch. It was he who introduced
us to those other excellent editors of our texts, John Hayward
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[Pg 206]</span>
and John Sparrow&mdash;the former a keen critic and helpful adviser.
E. McKnight Kauffer, Stephen Gooden and T. L. Poulton have
also done for us much more than illustrate a number of our books.</p>

<p>E. McKnight Kauffer (who drew us from the life for the last of
his illustrations to <cite>The Anatomy of Melancholy</cite>) at one time had office-room
with us. The hours I spent in discussing aesthetics with him
were stimulating&mdash;over-stimulating, we found, when there was work
to do. So, in the end, we nailed up a list of "red-herring words"
("functional," "the Artist" and so forth) which were not to be used
during office hours on pain of a fine of sixpence for each use. But
there was no sixpenny escape from George Moore. While <cite>Ulick and
Soracha</cite> was at the printers, he came almost daily, hung up his square
bowler hat and settled down to read aloud to us the revisions he had
made in his last batch of proofs. Each time it was an entirely new
text. The first version was almost illiterate. The second grammatical
but undistinguished. The third a transfiguration. It was fascinating
to see the process of his composition at close quarters: and our feelings
were undisturbed by anxieties about the printer's bill, for he had
proposed at the outset that he should pay for his own corrections.
They exceeded the original cost of the setting. In any event, who am
I to be critical? For one book I had 37 different varieties of title-page
set up. My friend William Maxwell, who printed this book, said
that he did not mind "losing" (printers are like farmers) on the text
of a Nonesuch book because he always made up his loss on the
title-page....</p>

<p>In 1925 we moved from our cellar to Great James Street and we
decided (with some misgivings) to incorporate the firm. It seemed
better to our auditors although we had suspicions that our subscribers
might be discouraged from collecting when they saw first the
formula "Ltd." on our letter-paper. We did them an injustice. The
partners became directors and shareholders. Vera Meynell bought a
little book entitled "The Secretary and His Directors" and, impressed
by the legal penalties that hedge about these offices, occasionally
wound up one of our long triangular discussions by taking down
the minutes book and saying: "Well, I suppose that this might as
well have been a board meeting." Once a year, for the benefit of
Somerset House we (the directors) presented to ourselves (the shareholders)
with all due formalities, a report on the year's accounts and
progress. Otherwise it made no difference.</p>

<p>Even the "mundial bad-time" (to quote the phrase of an Indian
friend) of 1930 did not seem to affect us or our customers much. But
the second year of the great depression brought onto the market many
hoarded copies of our books from the pickle-shelves of profiteers and
deflated some of their more astronomical prices. Our survival-value
(as luxury trades go) is perhaps due to the fact that even in boom-time
we tried to be honest traders, not using our success with collectors
to put prices as high as the traffic would bear, but giving a
constant ratio of good value in the sheer materials of book-making,
so that our paper, printing, binding were as good as any to be had
at the price.</p>

<p>No book-producing of our kind can subsist without sales in
America. It was our good fortune to ally ourselves in 1927 with
Random House of New York. No collaboration could be more
satisfactory from a technical or a personal point of view. It survived
the get-rich-quick temptations of 1929; it has survived the difficulties
of the depression. New blood and money entered the Press two years
ago when Cecil Harmsworth, Desmond Harmsworth and Eric
Harmsworth joined our board. But they belong to our Second Century,
not to our first.</p>

<p>We have avoided antagonisms, even avoided competition. My
friend Osbert Sitwell suggested that we should publish a satire on
Noel Coward; Coward that we should publish his satire on the
Sitwells. To both we said "no." How pleasant it would have been
to issue them together in a single book! When I found that Peter
Davies and the Nonesuch were both planning to reissue Cobbett's
<cite>Rural Rides</cite>, we met and tossed for it. He won; and our editorial
work was made over to him.</p>

<p>Of all Nonesuch books that by which I should best like the venture
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[Pg 209]</span>
to be judged is our Shakespeare, edited by Herbert Farjeon. It
brought us, among other things, a characteristic contact with T. E.
Lawrence. Lawrence had written a letter of fervent praise of the
Shakespeare to David Garnett; and I sought permission to use it.
David Garnett was himself our ambassador. Lawrence appealed
to the group of friends with whom he happened to be. "I don't want
my letter to be reprinted. I hate the advertising of my name and
opinions," he protested. To his obvious chagrin (for Lawrence had
a passion for publicity as great as his passion against it) his friends
supported his view. "After all," said they "you are not a Shakespeare
expert." That decided Lawrence. "I think it is my duty to give permission,"
he said. This was his letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We turn over to the Nonesuch Shakespeare. There you have
created a most marvellous pleasure. I have handled it ever so many
times, and read THE TEMPEST right through. It satisfies. It is
final, like the Kelmscot Chaucer or the Ashendene Virgil. And
it is a book which charms one to read slowly, an art which is almost
gone from us in these times. Every word which Shakespeare uses
stands out glowing. A really great edition. The tact and grace of
your editor have been surpassing. I think I like the size and shape
and binding almost as much as the text. The paper, too, is just
right. Altogether a triumph. One of the best things is that it can be
done again. Nobody will ever dare to produce the old type of edition
now, while your text stands there to reproach them. It means a
permanent improvement in Shakespeares."</p></div>

<p>"There they are, my fifty men and women." They must speak for
themselves, and I have almost silenced them with my chatter. For
their successors I can say only this: that it remains the ambition of
the Press to make a worthy edition, textually and typographically,
of every major English writer who has not already been appropriately
served. It will make these books for money, and has no shame in that.
We are not "Gentlemen Farmers" but workers at our trade. But we
are enthusiasts also, even in our middle years; and still propagandists.
Every well-designed book or advertisement or prospectus is the begetter
of others; and good printing is one of the graces of life even where life
is ungracious.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_212-2.jpg"  alt="" />
</div> <p>I have called this talk "Printing for Love."
I have not come to preach a gospel to you, but,
as I proceed to discuss printing and publishing
and book-illustration, it will be apparent to you
that one of the tenets of my religion is that we
workers should do our job, whether it be farming,
or gardening, book-keeping or building,
hewing coal or engineering, <em>with a will</em>. In Ecclesiastes the
Preacher advises us: "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it
with thy might." (Ch. 9, v. 10.) You may say that my job is a nice
job; that it is all very well for me to talk. I can assure you that
book-manufacture is a most intricate process. Things tend to go
wrong at every stage of production. Of worries we printers have
no end.</p>

<p>I often feel like an Irish farmer driving his pig to market. In one
hand he holds a stick to prod the pig. In the other a string tied to
the pig's leg. The pig goes to the right and then to the left and
the countryman wonders will he ever get that pig to the market.
Many of my books are like that pig. They drive me to despair.
And yet I love my printing like a mountaineer loves his mountains,
which he climbs arduously with sweat and aching limbs.
He has his reward when he reaches the summit and enjoys a fine
view, much as I enjoy the appearance of a book which I have
made with infinite pains. For both of us there is the joy of
achievement&mdash;of something attempted, something done.</p>

<p>"Oh, but," you may expostulate, "supposing you were a sewer-man,
could you bring love into your work?" I am sure I would.
In fact this case in point was quoted recently on the wireless. If
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[Pg 213]</span>I remember rightly, a speaker had referred with commiseration
to the lot of the sewer-man working underground among the
rats in the muck and stench of drains. He was called to task by
a most insulted sewer-man, who explained that his was a good
job&mdash;as good as any other. All the artists and the craftsmen who
co-operate with me&mdash;the paper-makers, the cloth-makers, the
tanners, the brass-cutters, the illustrators, the compositors, the
pressmen, the binders&mdash;aye, and the authors too, who write and
rewrite their text until it seems to me just right for the Golden
Cockerel&mdash;all of them have their worries and their toil, but their
work for me is done with love.</p>

<p>This is a question you might ask yourselves: can a beautiful
thing be made cynically? The dice is loaded against the unwanted
child of a loveless marriage. You cannot divorce your work from
your life. The two are parts of a whole. My religion is that love
should be the basis of all one's living and all one's work. In
so far as my books have been successful as works of art, it is because
they have been made with love.</p>

<p>Only with great self-restraint can I refrain from reading you
again that beautiful thirteenth chapter of St. Paul's First Epistle
to the Corinthians on Faith, Hope and Love&mdash;you remember
"Love suffereth long and is kind, love envieth not, love vaunteth
not itself, is not puffed up." Please read it now and then. It is so
important.</p>

<p>Perhaps, when you heard my talk was to be called "Printing for
Love," you thought, "Oh, he means printing without financial
reward." Believe me, love, too, hath its reward. Make what you
have to make, and do what you have to do, the way I advocate,
and you will have your reward. You must have <em>faith</em> in this. We
have got to fight our battles against obstructions, but, if we fight
well, and do what we are intended to do, everything is made
possible for us: the most miraculous things happen in their due
time.</p>

<p>At the Golden Cockerel I never choose a book because I think
it a good seller. Publishing friends are astonished when I admit that
quite recently I refused books offered to me by Evelyn Waugh&mdash;one
of the best selling novelists of today&mdash;and Sir Osbert Sitwell.
Of course I do not disapprove of the authors. I admire them
greatly. But in each case the manuscript submitted was not one I
wanted for the Cockerel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>I choose those books which I believe are <em>right</em> for this gay,
mirthful, versatile bird. At times he likes to play, at times to be
serious. He is interested in genuine old tales of adventure written
by explorers and missionaries, who may have travelled in birch-bark
canoes or quaint unwieldy ships. He is interested in old
peoples and their poetry. At present he is printing a translation of
the epic of Gilgamesh preserved on stone tablets. It is at least
six thousand years old and refers to a flood&mdash;like Noah's Flood&mdash;which
was recent history to people then. They were either more
or less civilized then than we are now, according to your view
of what constitutes civilization. They appear to have had more
to eat than we have now; they spent more time in making life
beautiful, and in thoughtful enquiry into spiritual things, such as
survival after death. They had libraries of books, not printed like
Golden Cockerels, but inscribed on series of stone tablets. There
were several "copies" of the epic of Gilgamesh in the library at
Nineveh.</p>

<p>To return to the Golden Cockerel, he also loves the masterpieces
of English and French literature and classical literature.
He is really a very human bird, kind and sometimes very amorous,
never spiteful, never morbid, never cruel. I personally pretend
to run this Press, but you know this chimeric cockerel really
rules the roost. When I and two friends took over the Press in
1933, I had quite different ideas for it from those I had accepted
a few months later. This Cockerel had his own personality and
traditions. I have rather enjoyed following his gaudy plumage
along the aerial avenues in which he seems to want to fly.</p>

<p>This has not always been easy for me. From time to time I
had partners to help me. Their ideas and mine naturally did not
always coincide. They gave in to me so often that just occasionally
I had, in common charity, to print and publish some book favoured
by one of them and which I did not myself like. Usually on such
occasions the finished book was to me abortive&mdash;a baby cuckoo
among my own fledglings. And they usually did not sell well.
Try as you may, you cannot do quite as well for someone else's
offspring.</p>

<p>It has always been of paramount importance that my books
should sell. As a husband and a father of three children, I have
had to make the Cockerel pay. Otherwise I should have had to
work at something else. Obviously you cannot make a large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[Pg 215]</span>
income from the sale of, say, half a dozen books a year in small
limited editions. But the Cockerel has never let me down and
always made it possible for me to keep on with this work. The
late St. John Hornby, who used to publish those monumental
Ashendene Press books at prices in the neighbourhood of 100 gns.
has said that, taken all over, he would just approximately cover
his costs. No profit! He was in a financial position to ignore costs
and the necessity to make his books pay. In theory that is good.
In practice I think it is wholesome that the products of your
labour should be commercially right. The absolute necessity
for you to sell what you produce makes you take notice of the
reactions of your patrons, keeps you from being too personal, too
idiosyncratic, too precious, shall I say too amateurish? Here I am
on difficult ground. It depends what you mean by amateurish. I
think of myself as a professional, but, to the trade publishers (who
would not dream of rejecting a manuscript from Evelyn Waugh),
I, and others like me, are looked on as amateurs, because we do
what we like.</p>

<p>This type of amateur, who does what he likes, scientifically,
is, I believe, very important. Into this category would fall research
students, and poets, and scholars, and inventors, and all sorts of
people. Has a scientific study ever been made of the amateur
throughout the ages and his influence on our life? If not, <em>there</em>
is a noble thesis for a research student, and he could make of it a
most interesting and I think saleable book. Perhaps <em>one of you</em>
will do it!</p>

<p>Now you may be thinking, "here's this chap and they tell me
he has a certain reputation as a printer. We get him down here
to talk to us about printing, and off he goes gassing about love,
and Noah's flood, and how to make money without trying to."</p>

<p>Please forgive me! You see I started as a printer and taught
myself how to dress a book according to my tastes. Then I became
a publisher. Let us make no mistake: the important thing is
the literary content of the book. How it is dressed is only of
secondary importance. It <em>can</em> be dressed any old how. Obviously
it is better when it is suitably dressed. But the dress, that is, the
printing and binding, must not be accorded <em>too</em> great importance&mdash;it
must not <em>vaunt</em> itself. If you ask a book-seller who has built
up a circle of people who collect "cockerels" <em>why</em> they like
cockerels, he will answer "because they are <em>cockerels</em>." By this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[Pg 216]</span>
he does not, I hope, mean "because they wear cockerel dress"&mdash;or,
shall I say, "plumage"?&mdash;but rather that they are, in their literary
content, in their dress, and in their illustration, examples of the
cockerel idea of what a book should be.</p>

<p>Of course it is no good the author thinking he has done everything&mdash;it
is the composite whole which is so engaging. I have
known some illustrators who think the author doesn't count. And
authors tend to think the artist a hack who should do what he is
told. Both may think that my own small contribution, as the
architect of the whole structure, is unimportant. Quite the greatest
joy for me in publishing is being in constant delightful intercourse
with these beautiful authors and artists. Beautiful is the
right word. I don't mean physically, of course, but in their natures.
Compare them if you like, to the most sensitive instruments designed
by man and you behold these God-made beings a hundred-fold
more sensitive. Go to the races and delight in the controlled
nervousness and the pent-up fire of enthusiasm in those beautiful
thoroughbred horses, and yet these dreamers of dreams, these
passionate romancers, these scholars, in all the controlled exuberance
of their knowledge and their zeal for research, these drawers
of pictures, who "see the light that never was on sea or land": the
horses are as nothing beside them!</p>

<p>Now, who are these authors and scholars and artists? Well,
some are, of course, professionals, in the sense that they live by
their art, and others, a lot of them, are civil servants, or architects,
or even prime ministers, who make their art a hobby. But can we
end there? Is not every roadman tidying his road, every thatcher
on the roof, or every good accountant neatly writing his accounts,
and every worker planting his allotment of a summer's evening,
an artist to a greater or less degree? He seems to me, watching him,
to be working for love. And so with those of us who make
seemly books.</p>

<p>Normally you have the publisher who chooses what books he
will publish, and contracts with the author to produce and sell his
work in book form. You have also the paper-maker, the ink-maker,
the type-founder, the maker of printing machinery and
plant. You have the printer, with his compositors who prepare the
type for press, his proof-readers, his pressmen who print the corrected
type on the paper, and his warehousemen, who deal out the
paper, and pack the printed sheets. You have the binders and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[Pg 217]</span>
manufacturers of material and machinery used in binding. Normally
a host of people have taken their part, however small, in
processes which go to the making of the finished book.</p>

<p>In a "private press" a very great deal of the work is concentrated
in the hands of its owner. In certain cases the owner himself
has set the type and printed it on a hand-press. His output has
thus been severely limited to the productivity of one single pair
of hands. This is not practical politics today&mdash;one's turnover is
too small to cover overheads. An alternative is to employ skilled
help with the type-setting and presswork. This was the method
employed by the Golden Cockerel up to 1933. For reasons I need
not go into, this method does not now pay.</p>

<p>The survival of the Golden Cockerel, since I and my friends
took it over in the midst of the great depression, has been due
in large measure to the method of production which we adopted.
By working in with the Chiswick Press, a famous old firm of
trade printers, we arranged that the Cockerel should have the
use of their plant and their skilled labour precisely as and when
we wanted it, without the necessity for capital expenditure on
plant or of providing the wages of skilled craftsmen, week in
week out, whether or not fully employed. Those were terrible
times, and our solution was the only one practicable. It was a
great experiment, but it worked. Of all the important private
presses in this country, the Cockerel alone has carried on&mdash;and
right through the war. In the books of the Golden Cockerel a
great tradition survives.</p>

<p>But the survival of the Golden Cockerel, and of the tradition
which it holds dear, is not achieved solely by its method of production.
On the contrary, there are other prime factors. I have
said that in my view the literary content of the book is more
important than its dress. We must not print for the sake of printing.
Firstly then I only print what I greatly desire to publish&mdash;something
that is really good. I think I have been successful in
finding a lot of new literary material which a sophisticated section
of the community does enjoy to read. Of course some of my
book-seller friends often beg me to print the old favourites, for
which there is such a great demand. Occasionally I oblige. I have
a Gray's <cite>Elegy</cite> at the binders now and a Keats' <cite>Endymion</cite> in the
press. But generally the Cockerel prefers to be more enterprising.
Look at all the literature we unearthed and published on the sub<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[Pg 218]</span>ject
of the Mutiny on the Bounty&mdash;book after book. And then
those volumes of Shelley's letters to Hogg. We found and published
the journal kept by the Pilgrim Fathers when they went to
America. Then there were the four previously unpublished books
by that legendary character, Lawrence of Arabia, and so on.
These are typical of the sort of thing we've found and published
for the first time. Not the old favorites, but, because they add to
literature and knowledge, so well worth making known.</p>

<p>The second important feature of Cockerels is their illustration
with engravings. More than any other process, engraving harmonizes
with type. Engraved wood-blocks and copper-plates are
very difficult to print as they should be printed, especially on a
durable rag-paper. They are therefore little used in these days
of mass-production. In the hands of the team of artists who work
for the Golden Cockerel, engraving as an artistic medium is
flowering as never before. By the enthusiasm and <em>love</em> which these
artists bring to their work, they advance their techniques year by
year, always improving on their own previous best, or the previous
best of their competitors, till there sometimes seems to be no
limit to the new effects they will obtain in their illustrations. It
is an undying satisfaction to the Golden Cockerel to be able to
encourage and advise talented engravers, and, by displaying their
work to the best advantage, to build up for them the reputations
they deserve. In the twenties it was Eric Gill, Robert Gibbings,
Eric Ravilious, David Jones, Blair Hughes-Stanton, Agnes Miller-Parker
and John Nash. In the thirties, and more recently, other
engravers like Clifford Webb, John Buckland-Wright, Reynolds
Stone, Gwenda Morgan, Peter Barker-Mill, and John O'Connor
have come to the fore. You have seen a few examples of my own
wife's work among the books I have brought along. And now
we have others too, of an astonishing brilliance, like Dorothea
Braby, coming on. It is impossible for me to be sufficiently grateful
for the privilege of being able in my small way to nurture this
flowering and progressive art.</p>

<p>After their literary content and their illustration, the third feature
of Cockerels which has sustained the Press, when other
presses have fallen out, is my policy of co-operating with the buying
public&mdash;of producing books which they can afford to buy.
Obviously the very rich men who can pay 100 gns. for a book
are now very few and far between. I have resisted the temptation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[Pg 219]</span>
to compete with the 100 gn. books&mdash;the "museum pieces." I have
resisted the temptation to spend so much on the production of my
books that they are inaccessible. With the levelling of incomes
there is now a considerable public, which, if it appreciates them,
can buy Cockerels at the 2 guineas or 4 guineas which their
production necessitates.</p>

<div class="figright illowp68" id="i219" style="max-width: 4.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_219.jpg"  alt="" />
</div><p>Those, then are the particular features of
Cockerels which have maintained the Press
through difficult years. That they are works of
art&mdash;the conceptions of a book-architect&mdash;would
not have sufficed, but, since they are expressions
of the art of the book, let us consider them
architecturally for a few minutes. The subject
is vast: I must try to epitomise it....</p>

</div>  <p>"It's fun, isn't it?" said my wife. "I've gotten so that
I can recall whole sonnets just by reading these first lines." We were
sitting in a patch of warm September sunshine under the walnut,
trimmed high like a giant umbrella, over the terrace back of the
press. Proof and copy of the long Contents of Edna Millay's new
volume of collected sonnets lay on the table between us as we idled,
savoring the first signs of Fall in the yellow leaves that the breeze
scattered about the gray flagstones. The air was spicy and the
ageratum and marigolds in the border matched the autumn colors
of the goldenrod and wild asters by the roadside. "I love gardening,
too," she said loyally. "I must pot those double begonias before the
frost gets them." I lit my pipe again and we went on with the proofs.
One hundred ninety-two pages set in Bruce Rogers' beautiful Centaur,
corrected, tied and wrapped, lay in neat piles waiting to be
taken to Camden for printing. We had worked at it off and on all
summer&mdash;painstaking work, but as rewarding, in our eyes at least,
as any labor we could think of&mdash;interesting copy, lots of problems to
argue over, the excitement of watching the author's mind at work
as proofs came back with alterations, changes that in some miraculous
way always added clarity or cadence to the lines; reading and re-reading
proof until the sonnets became part of us. Now it was finished,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[Pg 221]</span>and we had added one more book to the world's store and to our
little shelf of Golden Hind Press imprints. This book will be published
by Harper &amp; Brothers in an edition which would take us the
rest of our lives to print by hand. The design, the whole format and
all the composition is ours. The printing and binding will be done
elsewhere. Thousands of people will share our pleasure (or brand
us failures). We feel that books of this type offer golden opportunities
for the private press. We are not selling them, we are making
them our way for someone else to sell. However, most of our books
are printed on an old hand press, and given to our friends. So far
we still have our friends.</p>

<p>As a hobby, a private press may be as extravagant, or as inexpensive,
as one chooses to make it. It's fun and hard work and a challenge
to all the intelligence one possesses.</p>

<p>We started our press in 1927, named it The Golden Hind after
Drake's flagship that went on adventures no more hazardous than
ours. Elmer Adler called it "A Busman's Holiday" for a publisher's
production man. Perhaps he was right. At that time we knew little
about the problems&mdash;about as much as parents do about the first
baby. We don't know much yet, but we've had a swell time and
through it have made a jolly lot of friends which in itself is reward
enough.</p>

<p>We started with an ancient hand press of unknown vintage that
had been in use in the cut-room at the old Harper plant in Pearl
Street since before the knowledge of any man now living. I've an
idea that it may have come from England when Harpers started in
1817. Until the 1830's all their books were printed on hand presses&mdash;so
close are we to the beginnings of the art of printing.</p>

<p>Later, in Philadelphia, we found a big Washington hand press
in perfect condition that was going out as old metal. The bed was
smooth though the edges showed the nicks of hard wear from the
endless up-ending of the forms of some country newspaper. With
decent treatment it will be just as good a hundred years from now.</p>

<p>We made up in enthusiasm what we lacked in knowledge. It's
not always wise to know too much&mdash;it's a great damper on ambition.
Shortly after we started, a chance came to do a proposed definitive
edition of a well-known poet's works. It was to be in seven folio
volumes on handmade paper and no effort was to be spared to make
it right. Six hundred pounds of 18 point Lutetia and weight fonts
of the smaller sizes were ordered cast at the Enschedé Foundry in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[Pg 222]</span>
Haarlem, Holland, for the job. The type duly came, pages were set,
and sample forms printed and bound&mdash;and then the project was
withdrawn! In the light of accumulated experience I still break out
in a cold sweat at the thought of our colossal nerve to have taken on
such a task. Anyhow we had the type, and have used it many times.
With it we have set the limited editions of each new book of Edna
St. Vincent Millay's poems as they have come along, since 1928.</p>

<p>The status of a private press is difficult to define. As far as we are
concerned it is to make as well as we can only those books that we
want to do and to turn down all else; to have no "help," no payroll,
keep no books; to care not a hoot about a balance sheet which has no
column for satisfaction; and to take all the time we want to do the
job the way we want it. From the standpoint of factory speed we are
nothing to write home about&mdash;but we are not a factory and have no
ambitions in that direction. Ours is a private press and we work as
we please: that is where the fun comes in. We can work hard if
need arises; then hours have no meaning, and we work till we get
exhausted, fed up, and solemnly vow that we'll never do another
book. But we have been at it nearly fifteen years and we still think,
even though composition is exacting work, that such congenial labor
is the best fun in the world. Sometimes we have furious arguments
over punctuation, as though life depended on it. It is surprising how
much warmth can be generated over the position of a comma. When
we set <cite>Shakespeare's Sonnets</cite> we had at least six different sources to
work from, including a facsimile of the first edition. A single punctuation
mark will completely change the meaning of a sonnet, so
condensed is the wording to fit the mould. No two sources agreed
throughout&mdash;who were we to put in Shakespeare's points for him&mdash;so
the smoke got pretty thick sometimes, and the result was still
another reading of the sonnets embodying those details we preferred
from each: that's the fury of it.</p>

<p>The dream of every private press is to own its own private face.
We had our chance but didn't know what to use for money so we
let it go. One of the best presses in the United States now owns that
type&mdash;alas! We have many, too many, faces and borders and florets
collected from Europe when the world was sane, yet every new
volume seems to need something we do not have. Fred Goudy cast
for us at his shop at Marlboro two sizes of Mediaeval. We did Mrs.
Browning's <cite>Sonnets from the Portuguese</cite> in it. That type is precious
now since the matrices were lost in the fire that destroyed all his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[Pg 223]</span>
equipment at Deepdene. Long before the Monotype cut the Deepdene
face, Fred cast it for us. We used it for Dr. North's <cite>Hymns</cite>.
Then along came a book my wife wanted to do. Two hundred and
eighty-eight pages of 14 pt. A.T.F. Garamond all standing in galleys
made a lot of type for us to store. We used it again for Frederic
Prokosch's <cite>The Assassins</cite> and later for <cite>The Carnival</cite>. Gradually the
metal has crept into the house until scarcely a room is spared. We
sleep with 60 cases of type in stands on our sleeping porch. We
should be safe in a tornado&mdash;we have plenty of ballast.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago we did a group of Edmund Spenser's
<cite>Amoretti</cite> for Christmas. The lines breathe the spirit of another day
and we wanted to preserve, if we could, the romantic atmosphere.
I remembered that for the titles of the poems in <cite>The Queen's Garland</cite>,
printed for R. H. Russell in 1898, D. B. Updike had used an
odd Italic which he told me was Original Old Style cast by the old
Farmer foundry in 1854. Some one had had fun with the 18 point
size&mdash;it had a swell set of oversized vowels and all the long &#383;&#383; ligatures.
The resulting effect looked much like very early printing. The
mats were in the possession of the A.T.F. though they seemed never
to have heard of them and were a bit annoyed by my insisting on
seeing their file copy of the Farmer type book. There it was, and
eventually they dug them out and cast them for us. We printed the
book on our old Hoe hand press on Arak Ash white paper. For a
frontispiece we used Virtue's beautiful engraving of Spenser. It was
bound in tan boards with dusty rose cloth spine and a bright yellow
label. In many ways it is our favorite book.</p>

<p>Last year we had fun (perhaps I should say I did as my wife did
not give her fullest sympathy). 1940 was celebrated, and how! as
the 500th Anniversary of the Invention of Printing. The whole
country broke out in a rash of exhibitions, lectures, special articles
and such like, on poor old Gutenberg about whom practically nothing
is known to begin with, not even that he invented movable
type. If he did, he was only trying to fake manuscript writing and
should have been hung as a forger. I got pretty fed up on the tosh
that was being handed out. So, to even the score, I "discovered" in
a garret in Mainz, Germany, the private diary of Gutenberg's wife
(no one but I knew he had one). By quoting from her diary I
showed conclusively that all the credit was really hers. I had cuts
made of the old leather-bound volumes of the diary (four old volumes
from the Harper Medical Library) and a page of the manu<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[Pg 224]</span>script
(translated <em>into</em> German and written in the lovely hand of
Dr. Otto Fuhrmann). Dr. Herman Püterschein, that infallible authority
on things typographic, wrote a Foreword. It was titled <cite>The
Mainz Diary: New Light on the Invention of Printing</cite> and 200
copies went out for Christmas. Then the unexpected happened.
Letters began pouring in showing it was being taken as gospel.
Pundits, librarians, experts in the graphic arts, fell for it hard. My
wife threatened to disown me. Of course the tale hadn't a word of
truth in it. I had been in Mainz and Frankfort a few years before
so that the thing started off with some element of reality. A friend
in London gobbled it whole&mdash;I had to send a letter by Clipper to
keep him from showing it proudly to his friends. After all, my yarn
had about as much truth in it as most of the hash that I'd been forced
to listen to during the year and I'd gotten quite fond of Frau Gutenberg.
I felt, too, that I'd done my bit for the cause. Many of the
biggest libraries, including the Library of Congress, had requested
and received copies. Ten years from now it will pop up in some
bibliography of a Ph.D. thesis.</p>

<p>I had my fun all right.</p>

<p>But the boys got even with me. A year later, the editor of a well-known
art magazine and his wife, with careful deliberation and
much ingenuity, sold me down the river with a hoax that I gobbled
whole. So we are even and everybody is happy.</p>

<p>Why are we so cracked about a private press? I often wonder
myself. The house smells of printer's ink and type wash. Right now
there are eleven metal-strapped type boxes on the sunporch where
the expressman left them a week ago; and my wife is to have a
luncheon tomorrow. Fine looking mess. I'll get around to them soon.
There are piles of printed signatures of our Christmas book all over
the place. The composing room is crawling with undistributed type.
Can hardly work without spilling it. My pet Vandercook brayer has
fallen arches&mdash;it was left in the sun yesterday and its insides turned
to soup.</p>

<p>Next morning on my desk I found the proof of our new broadside
<cite>Emmer Jane</cite> with the drawing at the top beautifully colored by the
artist. It's swell. Presently the messenger brought in the advance
copies of the new <cite>Sonnets</cite> bound in blue natural-finished cloth
stamped in gold, just as I wanted it. I can hardly wait to get home
to show them to my wife. We must get that new type to use for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[Pg 225]</span>
<cite>The Ghost Ship</cite>. We'll start it this week-end. How slow the days go.
Isn't a private press fun!</p>


<p class="p01"><em>Postscript</em> 1951:</p>

<p>Still hard at it. We are older but no wiser. Nowadays the grand-children
come in the back door and call up the composing-room
stairs, "Arthur, may we play type and picture cuts?" They spend
hours at it and I spend hours putting things to rights.</p>

<p>The check-list has grown to 186 books and pamphlets. The work
is still as exciting as ever, though we try to check the fury a bit. The
skipper of the <cite>Golden Hind</cite> retired in January 1950, which released
more time for the press; being in business always was a nuisance.</p>

<p>We spent the summer doing a first edition of a Mark Twain book
for Harpers&mdash;mixed with a lot of farming. For a retirement occupation
we can commend a private press. It keeps up the interest in life.</p>

<p>Offers of work flow in, much more than we care to accept. We
are not in business and we have more projects of our own than we
shall ever complete.</p>

<p>It's fun to get up with the chickens and work together all morning,
spend the afternoon puttering about outdoors, and retire at
night dog tired&mdash;what my wife calls "nice tired," no nervous tension.</p>

<p>The <cite>Golden Hind</cite> is twenty-four years old but her seams are
tight and she manages nicely&mdash;who knows, maybe the voyage is only
nicely begun.</p>

</div> <p>I know of no better way of beginning this talk to
you tonight on P<small>APER</small>, I<small>NK</small> and T<small>YPE</small> than by first
sketching a brief outline of the Art of Printing.</p>

<p>Printing in its childhood was an art. The highest
period of any art is its childhood, because childhood
moves by spontaneous inner urge, not by rules and intellectual
bondage that runs all into fixed moulds. It is
an accepted truth that as skill and elaboration creep into
development of an art, simplicity, feeling and beauty
decline. The early printers were not weighed down
with rules, formulas and theories which have smothered
us today. With but one font of type, a wooden frame
with a screw attachment and a crude inking device,
they have given us books of strength and beauty that
we have never equalled.</p>

<p>We all like to think of the invention of printing as springing
Minerva-like from the brain of man. Printing is, of course, the
combination of paper, type, ink and the press; and these various
elements were some three hundred years in the process of springing.
Paper was the cheap substitute for vellum, and type the substitute
for hand-writing.</p>

<p>All of us are more or less familiar with the invention of printing
and with its God-like first-born, the Gutenberg Bible. Those
who have had the thrill of examining the great 42-line Bible have
told us that it is the most beautiful book ever printed. This is a
magnificent tribute&mdash;one that I have never heard contradicted.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[Pg 227]</span>
Just how much of the beauty of this Bible is due to the art of the
illuminator and how much to the skill of the printer has never
been told by those who represent it to be the most perfect
specimen of printing.</p>

<p>A few years ago a book speculator dissected an incomplete
copy, selling the leaves with beautifully hand-illumined initials at
twice the price of those pages without decoration. I hope this
speculator lost his ill-gotten gains in the stock market.</p>

<p>A thing of beauty stands alone, and I know of no fixed law by
which we can judge beauty except through the emotions; and
emotions are rather difficult to tabulate. I, myself, can only contemplate
the childhood of printing with amazement and admiration.
In its youth it exhausted every possibility of type
arrangement.</p>

<p>An estimate of the activity of those first wooden frames can
only be guessed at. In Venice alone, as early as 1472, over two
million separate volumes were printed. By the opening of the
sixteenth century the art of printing had spread to every civilized
country and the supply of its raw materials became so great that
the process of cheapening set in.</p>

<p>The first printers had selected as models for their types the
beautiful hand-written books of their day. The second generation
of printers modelled their types from those of the first printers.
The illuminator gave way to the wood-cutter and the fine art of
printing became a science, then a craft, and when William Morris
tried to stop its downward slide, in 1891, it was a trade.</p>

<p>During this downward trip through four centuries, weak attempts
to restore the art of printing to its first high place in the
life of man were made. Benjamin Franklin wrote on the "Improvement
of Printing Backwards," protesting the discontinuance
of the tall "f." But man was not interested in the intangible influence
of art as much as he was in the perfection of the machine.</p>

<p>The ink was hardly dry on the effusions of our modern printing
critics, when the collapse of over-production set in and silenced
them, I hope, permanently.</p>

<p>Writing about modern books in the latest edition of the Encyclopaedia
Britannica, Francis Meynell of the Nonesuch Press
says: "The type-setting machines used with as much skill as hand-set
type will give a better result, and in alliance with fast but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[Pg 228]</span>
very perfect cylinder printing presses, will give this result not to
a few, but to a multitude. It has taken us from the day of 'the
book beautiful,' and given us the day of the beautiful book."</p>

<p>The fast moving cylinder presses of the Nonesuch Press have
slowed up since this was written. And we can thank God that we
have some opportunity for reflection.</p>

<p>One of the modern criticisms of William Morris and the private
presses that he inspired is that too much stress was placed
on method. Method means how a thing is done and how a thing
is done is of very vital importance if we want to give our work
durability.</p>

<p>I have said before that it was William Morris who attempted to
stop the downward slide of printing. He was the leader in the
revival of what is known as "modern fine printing." It has been
said that Morris was inspired by a lecture of Emery Walker's on
the Golden Age of Printing. While not denying Walker's position
in this revival, we must admit that there is a vast gulf between
talking and doing. Morris's was a very simple yet positive personality.
There were no tints in his make-up. When asked if he liked
colors, his answer: "blue and red," tells us whole volumes in folio.
He had no tolerance for the effeminate printing of his day. He
even scorned the sunny pages of the Italian Renaissance printers.
It is no wonder that his Gothic books, in violent contrast to the
weak old styles and modern type faces of his time&mdash;and our time,
too&mdash;were startling. I have no doubt that some antiquarian hundreds
of years hence, delving among musty tomes, will find
Morris's books still giants in a land of dwarfs.</p>

<p>Whether you like or dislike Morris's books is of little concern
to me. But what is of vital importance to me as a printer, and
should be to all printers who are endeavoring to print books that
will last, is the honesty of William Morris. Morris knew, because
he was a collector of the earliest printed books, that those early
printed books could not have descended to him, looking as sparkling
and vital as the day they left their makers' hands, without
honesty of craftsmanship. It was this craftsmanship that Morris
revived, and that we today will have to revive again before our
books can have any claims to a long life.</p>

<p>Let me briefly describe to you the various processes used in
the making of books, beginning with the paper on which the
book is printed. Morris found no paper being manufactured that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[Pg 229]</span>
was suitable for his use. It was only after months of experiment
and failure, during which he worked at the paper mill himself,
that a satisfactory sheet was made for him. With the closing of
the Kelmscott Press after Morris's death, T. J. Cobden-Sanderson
and Emery Walker used his specifications for this paper at their
Doves Press. This mill still manufactures this paper, and it can
be obtained easily enough. But it is not popular with the printers
of today because its texture is so tough, its resistance to type so
great, that we rather choose the short cut to the Royal Road to
Fine Bookmaking, using the many counterfeits with their imitation
deckle edges and their artificial ageing at the mill. We also
like opaqueness in our paper, although transparency is usually
a guarantee of its quality. All-linen-rag quality paper can easily
enough be printed on if dampened first. By lessening the resistance
of the paper through dampening, the type can penetrate its tough
fiber, and the ink thus becomes a part of the paper itself. But by
taking the short cut and not dampening the paper, at least four
times the quantity of pressure and ink must be used. This over-abundance
of pressure and ink still does not penetrate the paper
but leaves the ink upon the paper's surface so that it looks to me
as if printed from an etcher's plate. The excessive amount of ink,
because of the heavy varnish used in its manufacture, has a tendency
to shine when dry, producing a luster that is hard on the
eyes. In time a film of oil will encircle each individual letter, discoloring
the paper, and the page will look like those cheaply
printed eighteenth-century books do to us today.</p>

<p>I know of no process in the making of a fine book more difficult
of perfecting than getting the right amount of pressure and ink
into the paper. In hand-made paper there is only an approximate
uniformity in the thickness of the sheets, and these variations can
be overcome by using a hand-press. The sense of touch must be
developed until you can feel the right amount of pressure through
the lever. The mechanical press is so regulated that it cannot control
the variations of the paper's thickness. The right pressure
can, of course, be applied to the average sheet&mdash;the heavier and
lighter sheets can be sorted out before printing. However, this
is seldom done. The paper is usually sorted when the finished
book is being collated.</p>

<p>I can speak with some authority on the importance of dampening
a sheet of fine paper. Such a process takes lots of time, but if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[Pg 230]</span>
you think the time not well spent compare a book from the
Kelmscott Press with any of the books of our best machine
printers of today. You will see that decay is already beginning to
set in in the machine book. The edges of the paper will soon turn
yellow and the ink begin to spread.</p>

<p>I hesitate to turn from the processes of making a fine book
endure without impressing upon you the importance of using
the finest quality of paper. The paper, and the ink that becomes
a part of that paper, determines the life of the book, just as stones
and mortar do in architecture. No matter how fine the type or
how beautiful the decorations, the book must die if quality be
lacking in both paper and ink.</p>

<p>And now just a few remarks about the binding of a book.
Bindings are the protection for the body of a book. Here permanency
decreases as use increases. Only those books that have
escaped usage have come down to us with their original bindings,
except those bound in limp vellum. Heavy boards encased in
leather were the protection of many early books. The swinging
of the heavy covers breaks the hinges of the book, and this leads
to destruction. William Morris revived the use of limp vellum as
a book covering.</p>

<p>Of far more importance than the cover in the making of a
fine book is the gathering and sewing. When the printed sheets
are folded a trained eye should put them together so that pages
either under- or over-inked may be taken out. If there are no
extras, then all the light pages can be put into one book, and the
dark in another. If this is done, the critic will say that the press
work is even.</p>

<p>After the book is assembled the sheets are sewn together by
hand, using a strong linen thread. Of course, they can be sewn on
a machine, but you might just as well save that expense by gluing
the sheets together. If you don't believe me, take a machine-sewn
book, before it is glued, pull off the first section, hold it up by the
last page and watch the book fall to pieces. Hand-sewn books are
sewn on either cords or tapes. Of course, you can have cords and
tapes on a machine-sewn book, but they will be false ones, pasted
on after the book has been stabbed to death.</p>

<p>I do not want to give you the impression that I am some sort
of John the Baptist crying in a wilderness of machines. Machines
are designed for special purposes and when we try to use them for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[Pg 231]</span>
a different purpose from that for which they were intended we
fail. You would think a carpenter who used a machine that was
made to drive nails in an orange box unbalanced if he tried to
adjust that machine to build a house. The delicately adjusted
printing press that Francis Meynell idealizes was designed for
producing our ephemeral printing.</p>

<p>A machine cannot create&mdash;it can only assist, directed by the
mind and imagination. The more that is left to the machine, the
worse the work. The machine can arrive at perfection, perfection
that is cold and dead and mechanical. And it is this cold and dead
perfection that brings me to the beauty of the book of today.</p>

<p>I would say that "Post-Modern" Fine Printing began in America
with Bruce Rogers, at the plant of William Rudge. It was Bruce
Rogers' books that have influenced American and English printers
more than any other recent single force. It was the "charm" and
finish of this man's work that none of us escaped. During the
years that Bruce Rogers was designing special editions at the
Riverside Press there were few collectors of his books. As late as
1920, I bought some of these books from the publishers. They
had been in stock nearly twenty years! Among them was "The
Song of Roland" at the publisher's price. When I first started
printing I was already an admirer and collector of these Riverside
Press limited editions.</p>

<p>Now William Rudge was a better business man than a printer.
He recognized the ability of Rogers and engaged him. Then things
began to happen to our Fine Art of Printing. The typographical
designer came into fashion, the machine was glorified and we all
became theorists. Printing was aimed at suitability. The scholar
and critic displaced the master craftsman and the advertising
artist was added by way of variety.</p>

<p>Each new type face, faithfully re-cut by the aid of the pantograph
and resurrected from our admittedly worst periods of
printing, was eagerly bought by our typographical experts. The
printers who had been quietly producing books, trying to make
them a little better than necessary, fell into the hands of the
publisher and the publicity agent. And the publisher announced
that the next limited edition of 1600 copies was completely over-subscribed&mdash;the
poor printer got one-third of what you had to
pay. It was a Wonderland, indeed, until Alice woke up, and the
printer was left with all the cards, and they were all blank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>I am very glad it all happened. I would go through any form
of hysteria again, if we could produce another <cite>Leaves of Grass</cite>.
Since I am going to talk about type, I know of nothing better
than to relate our experience in printing Walt Whitman's masterpiece,
for it has shown me the folly of theory and intellect in art.</p>

<p>We accepted this undertaking with enthusiasm. Here was an
opportunity to prove that we could print a book. The first deposit
had no more than been spent when the publishers announced it as
the finest book to be printed in America, and off we started on the
wrong track.</p>

<p>Well, the finest book had to have the finest type and the finest
type was the latest type. And it had to be a folio in size, because
for One Hundred Dollars you had to get a folio. We bought one
thousand pounds of the finest type; 18 point Lutetia, fresh from
a new designer in Holland. And we hired two printers to set this
bright new type and when it was all set, we pulled a proof and
started to put grass into it&mdash;pale green grass, and it looked like
grass and we pulled it out and tried again. Well, every time we
tried that bright new type it didn't look right. So we dug up some
of the latest theories about suitability, tried again, but it was no
use. The brain told us one thing and our eyes another.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, one thousand pounds of bright new type and
months of labor were tied up with strings and the Master Craftsman
was getting worried. He went to specialists for advice. They
said: "Try this new initial or this new picture," and the Master
Craftsman went back to his shop and bowed his head.</p>

<p>Then his tired eyes lighted on a dusty case of type, designed by
the artist Goudy but the critics had condemned it to the graveyard.
Wearily the Craftsman dug it up and set a page of Whitman
in it. Then he pulled a proof and Lo! He saw something that the
machine had discarded; he saw strength: he saw the strong,
vigorous lines of Whitman, born of the soil, without grass. He
saw what he had heard whispered before. He saw strong, vigorous,
simple printing&mdash;printing like mountains, rocks and trees,
but not like pansies, lilacs and valentines; printing that came from
the soil and was not refined in the class-room.</p>

<p>And the printer knew that the limited edition was not a racket
as long as he had honesty and sincerity, and reverence for the
best traditions of his craft.</p>

<small>THE TYPOGRAPHY OF WILLIAM MORRIS</small></h2>

<p class="p22 center small1">From <cite>The Printing of Books</cite> by Holbrook Jackson. Copyright 1938 by Cassell &amp; Company,
Ltd. Reprinted by permission of the publisher. First read as a paper, at the William Morris
Centenary Dinner of the Double Crown Club, London, May 2, 1934.</p>

<p>William Morris is an ironic figure. His achievements not
only missed their mark, but hit marks he was not aiming at. His
printing is no exception. The masterpieces of the Kelmscott Press
which he aimed at making "useful pieces of goods" were typographical
curiosities from birth, and so far removed from the common
way of readers that they have become models of what a book should
not be.</p>

<p>He was a Bibliophile, or more exactly, a typophile whose affections
became unruly in the presence of decorated incunabula, and,
although he was outwardly correct towards pure printing, his heart
was not there. According to Sir Sydney Cockerell he flirted with the
idea of a folio edition of <cite>The Earthly Paradise</cite>, "profusely illustrated
by Sir Edward Burne-Jones," a quarter of a century before the inception
of the Kelmscott Press. His personal taste was much the same
then as later, although he continued to pay homage to good as distinct
from fine printing. It was the "essence of my undertaking," he
said, "to produce books which it would be a pleasure to look upon
as pieces of printing and arrangement of type." Thus inspired by
the example of "the calligraphy of the Middle Ages, and the earlier
printing which took its place," and in spite of his passion for decorated
books he observed that the early printed books "were always
beautiful by force of the mere typography, even without the added
ornament with which many of them are so lavishly supplied."</p>

<p>Much has been made of the emphasis he laid upon the book as an
organic assembly of paper, type, and binding. But although few
printers or publishers in the nineteenth century had insisted upon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[Pg 234]</span>the excellence of these ingredients, as he did, the architectonic principle
had never been wholly ignored. But in the main it was unconsciously
observed. Deliberation is evident in the construction of the
Pickering books, in the Keepsakes and Table Books of the thirties
and forties, in the illustrated books of the sixties, and the later productions
of the Daniel Press; and, if we may leave England for a
moment, in such convenient publications as those of Bernhard
Tauchnitz, where there is rectitude to satisfy the demands of the
most austere of functionalists.</p>

<p>It was not, then, the architectonics of the Kelmscott books which
evoked a typographical revolution. Nor was it the pursuit of beauty
which always haunted Morris's intentions. "I began printing books,"
he said, "in the hope of producing some which would have a definite
claim to beauty." Many printers and publishers of the time would
have claimed as much. Bad taste in the arts and crafts is invariably
the result of beauty-mongering, and the more costly books of the
nineteenth century are littered with beauty from cover to cover.</p>

<p>Neither was it originality. Morris never sought to be original. He
was a revivalist, and all his work is derivative. There is nothing new
even in that, for all the arts and crafts are derivative, and originality
is apt to be a myth and often a nuisance. Morris was even less original
than many other earnest innovators, and the Kelmscott books
are derivatives twice removed. They are modern variations of the
early printed books of northern Europe, as they in turn were but
mechanical imitations of the manuscripts which preceded the invention
of movable types.</p>

<p>Nor again was there anything peculiar even in that, for all mechanical
evolution seems to proceed in the same manner. The earliest
railway carriages followed the lines of the stage-coach; the earliest
steamships were schooners and brigantines with funnels and paddle-boxes;
and the earliest motor-car was a horseless-carriage complete
with tail-board. It is not surprising to learn that the earliest printed
books were imitations of manuscripts, but it is surprising to find a
nineteenth-century printer of genius imitating the imitations.</p>

copies on paper and 13 on vellum.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[Pg 236]</span></p>
</div>


<p>There is, however, more than one difference between these mechanical
devices and the Kelmscott books. The engineers copied
because they could not think of anything better. Now and then they
even made concessions to beauty, in the form of superadded decorations,
much as Morris did. But there was a marked difference between
them, for Morris knew better. Although to him beauty meant
decoration or ornament, yet in the first edition of <cite>The Roots of the
Mountains</cite> he actually produced an undecorated book of great distinction.
The book is not only admirable in itself, but it has had a
better influence on recent typography than all the Kelmscott books
together. Morris himself was delighted with the book. He declared
it to be "the best-looking book issued since the seventeenth century,"
and added: "I am so pleased with my book, typography,
binding, and must I say it, literary matter, that I am any day to be
seen huggling it up, and am become a spectacle to Gods and men
because of it." His enthusiasm rings true, but this was a passing
fancy, for even then he was in hot pursuit of more opulent beauties.</p>

<p>It was the magnificence of the Kelmscott adventure which impressed
and influenced printers, professional and amateur, and
resuscitated the curious vogue for so-called "Private Press" books
artificially rarefied and deliberately beautified. But, in spite of many
extravagances and some few absurdities, the Kelmscott influence
has been beneficial. Morris reasserted sound principles, and the
richness of his books helped to secure their acceptance. "The road
of excess leads to the palace of wisdom." The style of the books
themselves, because of their massive individuality, must always
provoke differences of opinion, but in the house of books there are
many mansions, and room for all tastes, whims, and even fads.</p>

<p>I prefer my books pocketable, flexible, and legible. In the Kelmscott
books these qualities are not sufficiently balanced. Each is
there in some measure, but something is invariably added to weaken
proportion. William Morris (or worse, Burne-Jones) is always
getting between reader and author. I like my Chaucer neat. Morris
produced Chaucer as Henry Irving and Beerbohm Tree produced
Shakespeare. I suspect that enthusiasts for such productions are not
readers. The idea is supported by the fact that the majority of Kelmscotts
are still in mint state; it is not easy to meet a copy bearing the
honourable and endearing scars of use.</p>

by Bernard Quaritch in 1892. The edition: Two volumes, 300 copies
on paper and 5 on vellum. "As to the matter of the book," wrote Morris,
"it makes a thoroughly amusing story, instinct with medieval thought and
manners."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>Legibility is relative, as I am reminded by my own experience, for
myself when young did eagerly frequent Pickering's <cite>Diamond Classics</cite>&mdash;a
practice I should probably have defended with conviction
based upon sight rather than insight. I take a different view today,
not only of miniature types, but of rules and spacings generally.
Morris granted the necessity of legibility. In this he differed from
another poet and amateur of printing, Robert Bridges, who used
Gothic characters for the Daniel Press edition of his poems to induce
slow ingestion. Morris believed that solidity of type and setting
made for easy reading. By solid type he meant "without needless
excrescences" or "the thickening or thinning of the line," which,
with reservations, can be defended. Density of type area is a different
matter and, if I admit charm, I reserve the right to question even
aesthetical propriety in favour of legibility. The solid page is impressive:
solidity inspires confidence, but confidence, as we know,
is often illusion and not always guiltless of trickery. The first edition
of <cite>The Roots of the Mountains</cite> would probably have been more
readable with than without rules.</p>

<p>But although legibility must always be the first rule of printing,
there are other important principles. Morris summed them up in
the word "beauty" with impressive but dubious results, because of
his predilection for ornamentation. Any plain space for him was an
opportunity for decoration, or, in Ruskin's words, for "the expression
of man's joy in his work." He would go out of his way to make
books bigger than they need be so that he might have more space
to fill with his and Burne-Jones's illustrations. His type-faces became
picturesque, his margins inclined to pomposity, and his paper was
pretentious. The Kelmscott books are overdressed. They ask you to
look at them rather than to read them. You can't get away from
their overwhelming typography, and, even if you could, you might
still be cheated of your author by their high-minded purpose, for in
addition to being the creations of an impressive genius the Kelmscott
books were protests against the logical conclusions of mechanical
book-production.</p>

<p>All these things are hindrances to reading, and I still believe that
to be read is the destiny of a book, and that reading is best when you
are least conscious of print or paper or binding. Since the Kelmscott
books are not likely to induce that condition they must remain museum
pieces, typographical monuments&mdash;beautiful and ineffectual
angels beating in the void their luminous wings in vain.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Letters of the alphabet that are cast or founded for the purpose
of impressing upon paper are known as "types" and the impression
thus made as a "print." But every impression, from any raised
surface, is a "print." Hence the impression from the particular
raised surfaces known as "types" is called a "typographical"
impression; or, to use a more old-fashioned term, "letter-press."
The precise form of the "types" and the exact position they need
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[Pg 240]</span>to occupy upon the selected paper involve skill in the art that is
called "typography."</p>

<p>Typography may be defined as the art of rightly disposing printing
material in accordance with specific purpose; of so arranging
the letters, distributing the space and controlling the type as to aid
to the maximum the reader's comprehension of the text. Typography
is the efficient means to an essentially utilitarian and only
accidentally aesthetic end, for enjoyment of patterns is rarely the
reader's chief aim. Therefore, any disposition of printing material
which, whatever the intention, has the effect of coming between
author and reader is wrong. It follows that in the printing of books
meant to be read there is little room for "bright" typography. Even
dullness and monotony in the type-setting are far less vicious to a
reader than typographical eccentricity or pleasantry. Cunning of
this sort is desirable, even essential in the typography of propaganda,
whether for commerce, politics, or religion, because in such
printing only the freshest survives inattention. But the typography
of books, apart from the category of narrowly limited editions,
requires an obedience to convention which is almost absolute&mdash;and
with reason.</p>

<p>Since printing is essentially a means of multiplying, it must not
only be good in itself&mdash;but be good for a common purpose. The
wider that purpose, the stricter are the limitations imposed upon
the printer. He may try an experiment in a tract printed in an
edition of 50 copies, but he shows little common sense if he experiments
to the same degree in the tract having a run of 50,000. Again,
a novelty, fitly introduced into a 16-page pamphlet, will be highly
undesirable in a 160-page book. It is of the essence of typography
and of the nature of the printed book <em>qua</em> book, that it perform a
public service. For single or individual purpose there remains the
manuscript, the codex; so there is something ridiculous in the
unique copy of a printed book, though the number of copies
printed may justifiably be limited when a book is the medium of
typographical experiment. It is always desirable that experiments
be made, and it is a pity that such "laboratory" pieces are so
limited in number and in courage. Typography today does not so
much need Inspiration or Revival as Investigation. It is proposed
here to formulate some of the principles already known to book-printers,
which investigation confirms and which non-printers may
like to consider for themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[Pg 241]</span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The laws governing the typography of books intended for general
circulation are based first upon the essential nature of alphabetical
writing, and secondly upon the traditions, explicit or implicit, prevailing
in the society for which the printer is working. While a
universal character or typography applicable to all books produced
in a given national area is practicable, to impose a universal detailed
formula upon all books printed in Roman types is not. National
tradition expresses itself in the varying separation of the book into
prelims, chapters, etc., no less than in the design of the type. But at
least there are physical rules of linear composition which are
obeyed by all printers who know their job.</p>

<p>The normal Roman type (in simple form without special sorts,
etc.) consists of an upright design, and a sloping form of it:</p>


<p class="center p01">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&amp;</p>

<p class="center">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</p>

<p class="center">abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</p>

<p class="center"><em>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&amp;</em></p>

<p class="center p0"><em>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</em></p>

<p>The printer needs to be very careful in choosing his type, realizing
that the more often he is going to use it, the more closely its
design must approximate to the general idea held in the mind's eye
of readers perforce ruled by the familiar magazine, newspaper and
book. It does no harm to print a Christmas card in <img src="images/i_241.jpg"  alt="" />
but who nowadays would read a book in that type? I may believe,
as I do, that black-letter is in design more homogeneous, more lively
and more economic a type than the grey round Roman we use, but
I do not now expect people to read a book in it. Aldus' and Caslon's
are both relatively feeble types, but they represent the forms
accepted by the community; and the printer, as a servant of the
community, must use them, or one of their variants. No printer
should say, "I am an artist, therefore I am not to be dictated to. I
will create my own letter forms," for, in this humble job, no printer
is an artist in this sense. Nor is it possible today, as it just was in
the infancy of the craft, to persuade society into the acceptance of
strongly marked and highly individualistic types&mdash;because literate
society is so much greater in mass and correspondingly slower in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[Pg 242]</span>
movement. Type design moves at the pace of the most conservative
reader. The good type-designer therefore realizes that, for a new
fount to be successful, it has to be so good that only very few
recognize its novelty. If readers do not notice the consummate
reticence and rare discipline of a new type, it is probably a good
letter. But if my friends think that the tail of my lower-case r or the
lip of my lower-case e is rather jolly, you may know that the fount
would have been better had neither been made. A type which is to
have anything like a present, let alone a future, will neither be very
"different" nor very "jolly."</p>

<p>So much for Type. The printer possesses also Spaces and Leads
as a normal part of his typographical material, straight lines of
metal known as rules, braces, and finally a more or less indiscriminate
collection of ornaments&mdash;head and tailpieces, flowers, decorated
initial letters, vignettes and flourishes. Another decorative
medium at his option lies in his command of colour; red is, with
sound instinct, the most frequently used. For emphasis, heavy faces
are used. White space is an important item of composing-room
equipment&mdash;margins, blanks, etc., being filled in with what are
known as "quotations." The selecting and arranging of these
elements is known as Composition. Imposition is the placing of the
composed matter upon the sheet. Printing includes impressing in
due order, perfecting the sheet in due register (backing up), regulating
the inking, and achieving a crisp type-page. Finally the tone,
weight and texture of the paper are important factors entering
into the completed result.</p>

<p>Typography, therefore, controls the composition, imposition,
impression and paper. Of paper, it is at least necessary to demand
that it be capable of expressing the value of the composition; of
imposition, that the margins be proportionate to the area of the
text, affording decent space for thumbs and fingers at the side and
bottom of the page. The old-style margins are handsome in themselves
and agreeable to the purpose of a certain kind of book, but
are obviously not convenient in books where the page dimension
is unavoidably small or narrow, or the purpose of the book is to be
carried in the pocket. For these and other kinds of book, the type
may be centred on the measure of the page, and slightly raised
above ocular centre.</p>

<p>Imposition is the most important element in typography&mdash;for no
page, however well composed in detail, can be admired if the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mise-en-page</i>
is careless or ill-considered. In practical printing today,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[Pg 243]</span>
these details of imposition are on the whole adequately cared for;
so that it is possible to report that the mass of books presents a
tolerable appearance. Even a badly composed work may give a
good appearance if it is well imposed&mdash;good imposition redeeming
bad composition, while a good composition would be effectively
ruined by bad imposition.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The designer of the book, therefore, first determines his imposition
and then tackles the details of composition. The first principles
of composition do not require much discussion since they necessarily
follow from the conventions of alphabetical printing in the
Roman letter accepted by those for whom we are printing. The
matter is relatively simple. First, it is certain that the eye cannot
read with ease any considerable number of words composed of
letters embodying sharply contrasted thicks and thins; secondly,
it is none the less certain that the eye cannot agreeably read a mass
of words composed even in a rightly constructed letter, if the lines
are beyond a certain length. The most expert reader's eye cannot
seize more than a certain number of words in a given size except
in a proportionate length of line. Thirdly, practice proves that the
size of the letter must be related to the length of line. Respect for
these principles will generally protect the reader from the risk of
"doubling" (reading the same line twice). The average line of
words which the reader's eye can conveniently seize is between ten
and twelve. Nevertheless, the typographer, while exerting himself
to the utmost to respect this ocular truth, is daily confronted with
the fact that unavoidable conditions make it impossible for him to
secure a type of the duly related size, and that he is driven to use a
relatively small type. To obviate here the risk of "doubling," he
consistently inserts proportionate leads through the matter, so
opening the lines that the eye comfortably travels and returns from
beginning to end and from end to beginning.</p>

<p>The practice of leading, denounced in certain quarters as essentially
evil, is an inevitable necessity to a large proportion of printing;
and the skilled typographer, making the best use of his material,
makes in turn, wise use of leads. The orthodox high-brow view
that leads produce in every instance an unhappy weak-looking
effect will not survive a wide experience. On the contrary, it will be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[Pg 244]</span>
found that their absence may effectively ruin even a composition
in large type, so that it is true to say that the intelligent use of
leading distinguishes the expert from the inexpert printer. A slight
differentiation of type-face may make the practice advisable. Clearly,
while a letter of the size now under the reader's eye, with fairly
long ascenders and descenders, would not require leading unless
set to a measure of more than 3-1/2 in., there exist letters with short
descenders designed rather to sustain leading by rule than by
exception. Baskerville's is a type to which leading is invariably an
advantage. The problem of determining the amount to be given is
not to be settled by considering only the ascenders or the body of
the type, because breadth of letter is also a factor to be reckoned
with&mdash;some letters are narrow in respect to their height, while
others are wide. A composition in a round, open, wide letter,
chosen because it is rather loose (that is to say, the space between
the letters is greater, or appears greater, by reason of the curves of
the c, o, e, g), gains in consistency when there is a satisfactory lead
between the lines. It is often argued that loose setting is not admirable
in itself; to which it might be replied that the printer is
generally bound to carry out the instructions of his customer; often
to respect the wishes of an artist who may be illustrating the work;
and, not seldom, committed by the publisher to a paper-size dictated
by irrelevant considerations.</p>

<p>Further, it is obvious that the space between words composed
in a condensed letter may be less than that between words in a
round, wide form of letter. Where there is no leading between the
lines, and the composition is, for extrinsic reasons, necessarily
tight, it may be an advantage to set leads between the paragraphs,
even though this result in pages with uneven tails. In paragraphing,
it is important to realize that the opening sentence of a work should
automatically manifest itself as such. This may be secured by the
use of the large initial letter; the printing of the first word in
CAPITALS, or <small>SMALL CAPITALS</small>; C<small>APITALS</small> <em>and</em> S<small>MALL</small> C<small>APITALS</small>;
or by setting the first word into the margin. On no account
should the opening of a chapter be indented, since indention should
mark (and always mark) the subsequent sections, i.e., the paragraphs,
of the text. The abolition of paragraph-indentions is plainly
an undesirable practice; nor is setting the first word in capitals or
small capitals an agreeable substitute for the indention. The space
of the indention should be sufficient to be noticeable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>As both measures must be related, displaying a proportion
pleasing to the eye, the depth of the page follows from its width.
It seems that the proportions of the oblong are more pleasing than
those of the square; and as a horizontal oblong drives out the line
to an impossible length, and a two-column arrangement is tedious,
the vertical oblong has become the normal page.</p>

<p>Such are the elements of typography; and a volume built up of
type-pages composed in accordance with them will be generally
satisfactory. There remain only the page headings and the folio.
By ranging the headings inside towards the gutter, to the left and
right respectively, two pages are fixed as a unity; but they can also
be ranged outside to the right and left, or they may be centered. The
folio may be centered at the foot, or range either way at the top or
bottom (preferably, for quicker reference, on the outside), but it
cannot be centered at the top without cancelling the running page
headline&mdash;only to be done by exception. The running headlines
may be set in capitals of the text, in upper and lower-case of the
text, or in a combination of capitals. Full-sized capitals overemphasize
what is, after all, a repetitive page-feature inserted
chiefly for the convenience of librarians and readers interested in
the identification of leaves which have worked loose. If set in upper
and lower-case, the headline loses in levelness, so that it seems well
to employ <em class="gesperrt"><small>SMALL CAPITALS</small></em>; these are best separated by hair
spaces, since the unrelieved rectangular structure and perpendicularity
of capitals tend to defeat instantaneous recognition. Full-sized
capitals may well be used for chapter headings, with the number
of the chapter in smalls; both indications being hair-spaced.</p>

<p>The reader, travelling from the generally invariable blank at the
end of a chapter to the beginning of the next, finds a dropped
chapter head an agreeably consistent feature, which saves him
from feeling suffocated or overpowered by the text.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The foregoing elementary directions affect the main part of the
book, its body. There remains a section which goes before the text,
known as the "preliminaries," often complicated both in respect
to arrangement and draftsmanship. Before considering these, it
may be well to summarize our present findings&mdash;to concentrate
them into a formula. According to our doctrine, a well-built book
is made up from vertical oblong pages arranged in paragraphs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[Pg 246]</span>
having an average line of ten to twelve consistently spaced words,
set in a fount of comfortable size and familiar design; the lines
sufficiently separated to prevent doubling and the composition
being headed by a running title. This rectangle is so imposed upon
the page as to provide centre, head, fore-edge and tail margins of
dimensions suitably related not only to the length of line but to the
disposition of space at those points where the text is cut into chapters,
and where the body joins the prefatory and other pages known
as "preliminaries."</p>

<p>Now these first pages, being intended rather for reference than
for reading and re-reading, are less strictly governed by convention
than the text-pages. They consequently offer the maximum opportunity
for typographic design. The history of printing is in large
measure the history of the title-page. When fully developed, the
title occupied a recto page, either partially or wholly; and the
title-phrase, or the principal words of it, has generally been set in
a conspicuous size of type. Sixteenth-century Italian printers generally
used large capitals copied from inscriptions, or by exception,
from medieval manuscripts; while English use emulated the French
in employing a canon line of upper and lower-case, followed by a
few lines of pica capitals. Next came the printer's device, and at the
foot of the page, his name and address. These large sizes of upper
and lower-case, an inheritance from printers who were accustomed
to black-letter (which cannot be set in solid capitals), have gone.
The device has also vanished (it has been revived by a few publishers),
and thus the contemporary title page is generally a bleak
affair, exhibiting in nine out of ten cases a space between the title
and the imprint of the printer-publisher, so that this blank tends
to be the strongest feature on the page. When the device was first
abandoned, the author, printer or publisher took advantage of the
leisure of the reader and the blank at their disposal, to draft a
tediously long title, subtitle and list of the author's qualifications,
designed to fill the entire page. The present-day publisher goes to
the other extreme, reducing the title to as few short words as
possible, followed with "by" and the author's name. A professional
writer may insert, e.g., "Author of <cite>The Deluge</cite>" under his name or
there may be incorporated a motto; but apart from such exceptions,
three and sometimes four inches of space separate the author's
name from the first line of the imprint.</p>

<p>The result is that unless the title is set in a size of type out of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[Pg 247]</span>
relation to that of the remainder of the book, this space is more
conspicuous than the chief line. It is more reasonable to lessen this
space by shortening the depth of the whole piece from title to
imprint. It is clear that a volume in 12-point does not require a
30-point title unless it be a folio in double-column; and it is of no
consequence if the title page is a little shorter than the text pages.
There is no reason, other than a desire to be "different," for a
title page to bear any line of type larger than twice the size of the
text letter. If the book be set in 12-point, the title need be no larger
than 24-point&mdash;and may decently enough be smaller. As lower-case
is a necessary evil, which we should do well to subordinate since
we cannot suppress, it should be avoided when it is at its least
rational and least attractive&mdash;in large sizes. The main line of a
title should be set in capitals; and, like all titling capitals, they
should be spaced. Whatever may happen to the rest of the composition,
the author's name, like all displayed proper names, should
be in capitals.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Here we may pause to counter an objection. It will be contended
that whatever the value of our preceding conclusions, their adoption
must mean an increase in standardization&mdash;all very well for
those who have an economic objective but very monotonous and
dull for those whose aim is that books shall possess more "life."
This means that the objectors want more variety, more "differentness,"
more decoration. The craving to decorate is natural, and
only if it is allowed the freedom of the text pages shall we look
upon it as a passion to be resisted. The decoration of title pages is
one thing&mdash;that of a fount to be employed in books is another.
Our contention, in this respect, is that the necessities of a mass-production
book and the limited edition differ neither in kind nor
in degree, since all printing is essentially a means of the multiplication
of a text set in an alphabetical code of conventional symbols.
To disallow "variety" in the vital details of the composition is not
to insist upon uniformity in display. As already pointed out, the
preliminary pages offer scope for the utmost typographical ingenuity.
Yet even here, a word of caution may be in place, so soon do
we forget, in arranging any piece of display (above all, a title page),
the supreme importance of sense. Every character, every word,
every line should be seen with maximum clearness. Words should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[Pg 248]</span>
not be broken except unavoidably, and in title pages and other
compositions of centred matter, lines should hardly begin with
such feeble parts of speech as prepositions and conjunctions. It is
more reasonable, as assisting the reader's immediacy of comprehension,
to keep these to the ends of lines or to centre them in
smaller type and so bring out the salient lines in a relatively
conspicuous size.</p>

<p>No printer, in safeguarding himself from the charge of monotony
in his composition, should admit, against his better judgment, any
typographical distraction doing violence to logic and lucidity in
the supposed interests of decoration. To twist his text into a triangle,
squeeze it into a box, torture it into the shape of an hour-glass
or a diamond is an offence requiring greater justification than
the existence either of Italian and French precedents of the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries, or of an ambition to do something new in
the twentieth. In truth, these are the easiest tricks of all, and we
have seen so much of them during the late "revival of printing"
that we now need rather a revival of restraint. In all permanent
forms of typography, whether publicly or privately printed, the
typographer's only purpose is to express, not himself, but his
author. There are, admittedly, other purposes which enter into the
composition of advertisement, publicity and sales matter; and
there is, of course, a very great deal common to both book and
advertisement composition. But it is not allowable to the printer
to relax his zeal for the reader's comfort in order to satisfy an
ambition to decorate or to illustrate. Rather than run this risk the
printer should strive to express himself by the use of this or that
small decorative unit, either of common design supplied by the
type founders or drawn for his office by an artist. It is quite true
that to an inventive printer decoration is not often necessary. In
commercial printing, however, it seems to be a necessity, because
the complexity of our civilization demands an infinite number of
styles and characters. Publishers and other buyers of printing, by
insisting upon a setting which shall express <em>their</em> business, <em>their</em>
goods, <em>their</em> books and nobody else's business or goods or books,
demand an individuality which pure typography can never hope
to supply. But book-printers, concerned with the permanently
convenient rather than with the transiently sensational or the merely
fashionable, should be on their guard against title-page borders,
vignettes and devices invented to ease their difficulties. There is no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[Pg 249]</span>
easy way with most title pages; and the printer's task is rendered
more difficult by the average publisher's and author's incompetence
to draft a title or to organize the preliminaries in reasonable
sequence.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Those who would like to lessen or vary the tendency towards
standardization in day-today book production have a field for
their activity in the last-mentioned pages. The position on the page
of the half-title, title, dedication, etc., and their relation to each
other, are not essentially invariable. Nevertheless, as it is well for
printers and publishers to have rules, and the same rules, it may be
suggested that the headings to Preface, Table of Contents, Introduction,
etc., should be in the same size and fount as the chapter
heads; and should be dropped if they are dropped. The order of
the preliminaries remains to be settled. With the exception of the
copyright notice, which may be set on the verso of the title page,
all should begin on a recto. The logical order of the preliminary
pages is Half-title or Dedication (I see no reason for including
both), Title, Contents, Preface, Introduction. The certificate of
"limitation," in the case of books of that class, may face the title
where there is no frontispiece, be incorporated with the half-title,
or be taken to the end of the volume. This order is applicable to
most categories of books. Novels need neither Table of Contents
nor List of Chapters, though one or the other is too often printed.
If it is decided to retain either, it would be reasonable to print it
on the back of the half-title and facing the title page, so that the
structure, scope and nature of the book will be almost completely
indicated to the reader at a single opening. Where the volume is
made up of a few short stories, their titles can be listed in the
otherwise blank centre of the title page.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Fiction, Belles-Lettres and Educational books are habitually first
published in portable, but not pocketable formats; crown octavo
(5 by 7-1/2 in.) being the invariable rule for novels published as such.
The novel in the form of Biography will be published as a Biography,
demy octavo (5-5/8 by 8-3/4 in.), the size also for History,
Political Study, Archaeology, Science, Art and almost everything
but Fiction. Novels are only promoted to this format when they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[Pg 250]</span>
have become famous and "standard"; when they are popular
rather than famous they are composed in pocket (4-1/2 by 6-3/4 in.)
editions. <em>Size</em>, therefore, is the most manifest difference between
the categories of books.</p>

<p>Another obvious difference is <em>bulk</em>, calculated in accordance
with the publisher's notion, first, of the general sense of trade
expectation and, secondly, of the purchasing psychology of a public
habituated to certain selling prices vaguely related to number of
pages and thickness of volume (inconsistently enough, weight does
not enter into these expectations). These habits of mind have consequences
in the typography; they affect the choice of fount and
size of type, and may necessitate the adoption of devices for
"driving out," i.e., making the setting take up as much room as
possible. By putting the running headline between rules or rows of
ornaments; introducing unnecessary blanks between chapters;
contracting the measure; exaggerating the spaces between the
words and the lines; excessively indenting paragraphs; isolating
quoted matter with areas of white space: inserting wholly unnecessary
sectional titles in the text and surrounding them with space;
contriving to drive a chapter ending to the top of a recto page so
that the rest of it and its verso may be blank; using thick paper;
increasing the depth of chapter beginnings and inserting very large
versals thereto; and so on, the volume can be inflated to an extra
sixteen pages and sometimes more&mdash;which is a feat the able typographer
is expected to accomplish without showing his hand.</p>

<p>Limited editions of standard authors, or of authors whose publishers
desire them to rank as such, are commonly given a rubricated
title or some other feature not strictly necessary. A dreadful example
of overdone rubrication is to be found in an edition of Thomas
Hardy's verse, in which the running heads throughout the book are
in red&mdash;the production of a firm which desired to make an impression
on the purchaser in view of the price asked for the edition.
This could have been better done by reserving colour for the initial
letters. Handmade paper is generally used for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éditions de luxe</i>, and
none but the brave among publishers will disregard the superstitious
love of the book-buying classes for its untrimmed, ugly and
dirt-gathering edges. That most of the public prefer to have it so is
because a trimmed book looks "ordinary" to them. Any book
which is "different" from the "ordinary" in one superficial way or
another is apt to impress those lacking trade experience. And there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[Pg 251]</span>
has been a notable increase during recent years in the category of
books, generally illustrated, known to the trade as <em>fine printing</em>,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éditions de luxe</i>, <em>press-books</em>, <em>limited editions</em>, <em>collectors' books</em>, etc.
Hence, it is hoped that the above setting out of the first principles
of typography may give the discriminating reader some sort of
yardstick which he can apply not only to the entries catalogued by
the book-sellers as limited editions, but to the output of publishers
responsible for printing the literary and scientific books which are
more necessary to society, and are often designed with greater
intelligence.</p>

<em><small>American Type Designers and Their Work</small></em></h2>


<p class="center p22 small1">Published by The Lakeside Press 1947-1948. Reprinted by permission of the
publisher.</p>

<p>A piece of paper about two inches square, originally pinned
to the manuscript of the Rev. Ezra Stiles's diary in the Yale
University Library is all that remains of the first original American
type design. It is a proof of letters made by Abel Buell, a
Connecticut Yankee, in 1769.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Buell was his own designer, punch
cutter, and caster, since in his day, as for many years after, the
making of type was entirely a hand operation. Not the least exacting
part of the work was the cutting of the punch on the
end of a short bar of softened steel. It was not until the invention
of the Benton pantograph punch-cutting machine in
1885 that any other method was known. All type made before
1885 was therefore dependent on hand punch cutting, and
the designer of the type was almost always the same man who cut
the punches.</p>


<p>Who these type designers were after Buell is a matter of uncertainty
and obscurity. The first type specimen book in America
was that of Binny &amp; Ronaldson of Philadelphia, issued in
1812; and from then almost to our own day the type foundries
have taken the credit for the type designs which they have offered
for sale. Type designers, like architects, got no credit; possibly
Modesty, with a backward glance at old specimen books, raised
a warning finger, and the designers were willing to let the foundries
have whatever glory there was.</p>

<p>Abel Buell and his contemporaries and successors followed the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[Pg 253]</span>general trends in design in the arts as a whole. The Greek Revival
and the Victorian Age, marked by the two great expositions at
London and Philadelphia with their crudities and extravagancies
in design, found echoes in our imitative craft of printing. So it is
not surprising that type design began to improve, along with the
other arts, with the advent of the '90's. We have always followed
European and especially English models, and it is natural that
the upheaval in type design in England under Morris's influence
had immediate repercussions here. But while imitations of Kelmscott
types were soon on the market, two surprisingly original
American designs appeared at the same time as the imitations.
About 1894 or 1895 the Central Type Foundry of St. Louis
introduced a face which became widely used, called (for no
better reason than attends the christening of most type faces)
"De Vinne." It is of unknown parentage, though there is some
reason to suppose that it descended from the Elzevirs; but it was
a face of character and distinction. At the same time the same
foundry brought out another design which had an acknowledged
father&mdash;Will Bradley. Of this face it has been said that it has
"remarkably bold letters, with peculiarities of form never before
attempted." Thus we have in the De Vinne and the Bradley faces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[Pg 254]</span>
two fresh and distinctively American types, destined to be the
forerunners of many others. And in one case the name of the
designer was definitely attached.</p>

<p>With the invention of the pantograph punch cutter, type design
became an "art" rather than a craft, and as might be expected
the personality of the designer became for various reasons more
important. It is not without interest that the chief designer of
the American Type Founders Company&mdash;a man responsible for
almost the whole type output of that foundry for many years&mdash;Morris
Fuller Benton, was the son of the man whose machines
were responsible for this revolution in type design. For it was
the two basic machines invented and developed by Linn Boyd
Benton which made it possible for those unskilled in the intricacies
of type making to provide the basic designs for type. The
machines were very ingenious, and the designs partook of the
"faultily faultless, icily regular" perfection of the mechanical
device. This method of making type faces involved the drawing
of the design and the making of two or three patterns in thin
brass of the outline of the letter&mdash;each pattern good for several
sizes of type, and slightly modified for another group of sizes.
This is the way in which modern type is designed. It is the reason
why such a type series as "Cheltenham," designed by the architect
Bertram G. Goodhue in 1900 for the Mergenthaler Linotype
Company, while very expertly handled in the details, seems monotonous
in mass; whereas the Caslon type of the original cutting
shows all the inevitable variations of hand work.</p>

<p>A survey of the types of the first quarter of the present century,
made by the Editor of the <cite>Inland Printer</cite> in 1927, displays
161 type faces brought out by seven or eight of the leading foundries
between 1900 and 1925. Of these, it was possible to name
the designers of 72, almost all from the Barnhart Brothers &amp;
Spindler foundry of Chicago, whose records seem to have been
in better shape, or whose generosity was more spontaneous.
Oswald Cooper, Sydney Gaunt, Will Ransom, Robert Wiebking,
and George Trenholm were the chief names. It is unfortunate
that the names of the designers of the types put out by the
American Type Founders Company have not been preserved except
in rare instances. Of course, Benton was responsible for the
greater portion, and on the aesthetic side they occasionally scored
a triumph as in the case of the "Cloister" face.</p>

<p>The list included in the <cite>Inland Printer's</cite> survey fails to include
some of the outstanding designs of the period. Goodhue's
"Merrymount" was done in 1894, but after 1900 we have Mr.
Rogers's "Centaur," Mr. Hunter's odd but forceful types (properly
cut on punches by the designer), the output of the rapidly
growing composing-machine industry, and Frederic W. Goudy's
fifty designs completed in that quarter century. Goudy's output
of six score type designs in fifty years is an amazing record, one
probably never equalled. Such designs as those for "Goudy Modern,"
"Goudy Text," and "Hadrian" would establish his reputation.
He had his limitations as a designer&mdash;most of his designs lack
a certain crispness&mdash;but his versatility was extraordinary.</p>

<p>In the years since 1925 new designers have come to the fore:
Blumenthal with his "Emerson," Dwiggins with his "Electra"
and "Caledonia," Ruzicka with his "Fairfield," and Chappell with
his "Lydian." This brief survey cannot hope to mention all
types or designs which American designers have contributed,
but it is well to see if any tendencies can be detected.</p>

<p>The type which Buell made in 1759, as well as the type of his
immediate successors into the first decades of the nineteenth
century, were mainly variations on the so-called "modern romans"
of Didot, Bodoni, Austen, and Thorowgood. As the artistic
styles in design in general, not alone in type, gradually lost the
evolutionary force which has developed letter forms through the
centuries, eccentricity and anarchy came into play. The nineteenth-century
types as shown in the specimen books of Bruce,
Connor, Farmer, etc., and exhibited in all their grotesque horror
in Fred Phillips' "Old-fashioned Type Book," had no legitimate
parentage, and they are as well relegated to the bizarre and
pseudo-nostalgic advertisement. The result of the Kelmscott
"revival" was to turn attention to type forms of the past which
could be revived for modern use, and the type designers after
1900 did a remarkable piece of work in introducing good type
faces. The advertisers have been eager to use new and novel faces,
and have greatly stimulated this activity, even in many cases over-exciting
it. The most interesting result has been the renewed interest
in calligraphy. First directed toward new forms of script,
the truer form of broad pen lettering is now beginning to influence
type design, to free it from too slavish a devotion on the one
hand to the serif, and on the other to a too-free rejection of the
serif altogether. Such a face as Mr. Chappell's "Lydian" is an
example of real advance in design, and if one could adduce European
examples, more could be cited.</p>

<p>American designers have not developed many new or good
book faces; such types as Oxford, Centaur, Emerson, Fairfield,
Electra, are the exception. Their efforts have been given to the
drawing of display and advertising types&mdash;too often not to the
enrichment of the printer's repertory. It is quite as true now as
in the past that distortions of the normal Roman letter form in the
direction of extra condensed or extra heavy or very light mono-line
letters result in eccentricities which have no permanent value.
On the other hand such novel type designs as Garamond Bold
Italic, Hadriano, the newspaper Ionics, and Lydian are meritorious
additions to the printer's fonts. When it is realized that eccentricity
and originality are not the same thing, we may expect
from our increasingly intelligent designers indigenous types of
usefulness and charm.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TYPOGRAPHY&mdash;ERIC GILL</h2>


<p class="p22 center small1">From <cite>Printing &amp; Piety</cite>, An Essay on Typography by Eric Gill. Copyright 1931 by
J. M. Dent and Sons, Ltd., London. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</p>


<p>One of the most alluring enthusiasms
that can occupy the mind of the
letterer is that of inventing a really
logical and consistent alphabet
having a distinct sign for every distinct
sound. This is especially the
case for English speaking people:
for the letters we use only inadequately
symbolize the sounds of
our language. We need many new
letters and a revaluation of existing
ones. But this enthusiasm has no practical value for the typographer;
we must take the alphabets we have got, and we must take these alphabets
in all essentials as we have inherited them.</p>

<p>First of all, then, we have the ROMAN ALPHABET of CAPITAL
letters (Upper-case), and second the alphabet which printers call
ROMAN LOWER-CASE. The latter, tho' derived from the Capitals,
is a distinct alphabet. Third we have the alphabet called <em>ITALIC</em>,
also derived from the Capitals but through different channels. These
are the three alphabets in common use for English people.</p>

<p>Are there no others? It might be held that there are several; there
are, for example, the alphabet called Black Letter, and that called
Lombardic. But these are only partial survivals, and very few people
could, without reference to ancient books, write down even a complete
alphabet of either. As far as we are concerned in modern England,
Roman Capitals, Lower-case and Italics are three different
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[Pg 258]</span>alphabets, and all are current "coin." But however familiar we are
with them, their essential differences are not always easily discovered.
It is not a matter of slope or of serifs or of thickness or thinness.
These qualities, though one or other of them may be commonly
associated with one alphabet more than another, are not essential
marks of difference. A Roman Capital A does not cease to be a
Roman Capital A because it is sloped backwards or forwards, because
it is made thicker or thinner, or because serifs are added or
omitted; and the same applies to Lower-case and Italics (see Fig. 1).</p>

<div class="chapter">

  </div>
 <p class="pc1 center small1">Figure 1 illustrates the contention that slope in either direction does
not deprive Capitals, Lower-case or Italics of their essential differences.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp78" id="i258-2" style="max-width: 6.25em;">

<p class="pc1 center small1">Figure 2 in which the upper line of letters is essentially "Roman Lower-case";
the lower essentially "Italic."</p>

<p>The essential differences are obviously between the forms of the
letters. The following letters, abdefghklmnqrtu and y, are not
Roman Capitals, and that is all about it. The letters shown in the
lower line of Fig. 2 are neither Capitals nor Lower-case. The conclusion
is obvious: there is a complete alphabet of Capital letters,
but the Lower-case takes ten letters from the Capital alphabet, and
the Italic takes ten from the Capitals and twelve from the Lower-case.
Figure 3 shows the three alphabets completed, and it will be
seen that CIJOPSVWX and Z are common to all three, that
bdhklmnqrtu and y are common to Lower-case and Italics; that
ABDEFGHKLMNQRTU and Y are always Capitals; and that
aef and g are always Lower-case.</p>

<p class="pc1 small1">Figure 3 shows the differences and similarities between the three "current"
alphabets. Note: the curve of the Italic y's tail is due to exuberance,
and not to necessity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>But tho' this is a true account of the essential differences between
the three alphabets, there are customary differences which seem
almost as important. It is customary to make Roman Capitals upright.
It is customary to make Lower-case smaller than Capitals when
the two are used together; and it is customary to make Italics narrower
than Lower-case, sloping towards the right and with certain
details reminiscent of the cursive hand-writing from which they are
derived. Fig. 4 shows the three alphabets with their customary as
well as their essential differences.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp85" id="i260" style="max-width: 9.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_260.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p class="pc1 center small1">Figure 4 shows the Capitals, Roman Lower-case and Italics with their
customary as well as their essential differences.</p>

<p>Properly speaking there is no such thing as an alphabet of Italic
Capitals, and where upright or nearly upright Italics are used ordinary
upright Roman Capitals go perfectly well with them. But as
Italics are commonly made with a considerable slope and cursive
freedom, various sorts of sloping and quasi-cursive Roman Capitals
have been designed to match. This practice has, however, been
carried to excess; the slope of Italics and their cursiveness have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[Pg 261]</span>
much overdone. In the absence of punch cutters with any personal
sensibility as letter designers, with punch cutting almost entirely
done by machine, the obvious remedy is a much more nearly upright
and non-cursive Italic, and for Capitals the ordinary upright Roman.
Even with a nearly upright Italic, the mere presence of the Italic aef
and g alters the whole character of a page, and with a slight narrowness
as well as a slight slope, the effect is quite different from that of
a page of Lower-case.</p>

<p>The common practice of using Italics to emphasize single words
should be abandoned in favour of the use of the ordinary Lower-case
with spaces between the letters (<em class="gesperrt">letter-spaced</em>). The proper
use of Italics is for quotations and footnotes, and for books in
which it is or seems desirable to use a lighter and less formal style of
letter. In a book printed in Italics upright Capitals may well be used,
but if sloping Capitals be used they should only be used as initials&mdash;they
go well enough with Italic Lower-case, but they do not go with
one another.</p>

<p>We have, then, the three alphabets, and these are the printer's
main outfit; all other sorts of letters are in the nature of fancy letters,
useful in inverse proportion to the importance and quantity of his
output. The more serious the class of book he prints, the wider the
public to whom he appeals, so much the more solemn and impersonal
and normal will be and should be his typography. But he will
not call that book serious which is merely widely bought, and he
will not call that a wide appeal which is made simply to a mob of
forcibly educated proletarians. A serious book is one which is good
in itself according to standards of goodness set by infallible authority,
and a wide appeal is one made to intelligent people of all times and
nations.</p>

<p>The invention of printing and the breakdown of the medieval
world happened at the same time; and that breakdown, tho' hastened
by corruption in the Church, was chiefly caused by the recrudescence
of a commercialism which had not had a proper chance since the
time of the Romans. The invention of double-entry book-keeping
also happened about the same time, and though, as with modern
mechanical invention, the work was done by men of brains rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[Pg 262]</span>
than men of business, it was the latter who gained the chief advantage.</p>

<p>Printing, a cheaper method of reproducing books than hand-writing,
came therefore just at the right moment. Since its first fine
careless rapture, and in spite of the genuinely disinterested efforts of
ecclesiastical presses, University presses and the work of many
notable individual printers and type-founders, the history of printing
has been the history of its commercial exploitation. As is natural
with men of business, the worse appears the better reason. Financial
success is, rightly, their only aim, and technical perfection the only
criterion they know how to apply to their works.</p>

<p>TYPOGRAPHY (the reproduction of lettering by means of movable
letter types) was originally done by pressing the inked surface
or "face" of a letter made of wood or metal against a surface of
paper or vellum. The unevenness and hardness of paper, the irregularities
of types (both in respect of their printing faces and the dimensions
of their "bodies") and the mechanical imperfections of
presses and printing methods made the work of early printers notable
for corresponding unevennesses, irregularities and mechanical
imperfections. To ensure that every letter left its mark more or less
completely and evenly, considerable and noticeable impression was
made in the paper. The printed letter was a coloured letter at the
bottom of a ditch.</p>

<p>The subsequent development of typography was chiefly die development
of technical improvements, more accurately cast types,
smoother paper, mechanically perfect presses. Apart from the history
of its commercial exploitation, the history of printing has been
the history of the abolition of the impression. A print is properly a
dent made by pressing; the history of letter-press printing has been
the history of the abolition of that dent.</p>

<p>But the very smooth paper and the mechanically very perfect
presses required for printing which shall show no "impression" can
only be produced in a world which cares for such things, and such
a world is of its nature inhuman. The industrial world of today is
such, and it has the printing it desires and deserves. In the industrial
world Typography, like house building and sanitary engineering, is
one of the necessary arts&mdash;a thing to be done in working hours,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[Pg 263]</span>
those during which one is buoyed up by the knowledge that one is
serving one's fellow men and neither enjoying oneself like an artist
nor praising God like a man of prudence. In such a world the only
excuse for anything is that it is of service.</p>

<p>Printing which makes any claim on its own account, printers who
give themselves the status of poets or painters, are to be condemned;
they are not serving; they are shirking. Such is the tone of the more
romantic among men of commerce; and the consequence is a pseudo-asceticism
and a bastard aesthetics. The asceticism is only a sham
because the test of service is the profits shown in the accounts; and
the aesthetics is bastard because it is not founded upon the reasonable
pleasure of the mind of the workman and of his customer, but
upon the snobbery of museum students employed by men of commerce
to give a saleable appearance to articles too dull otherwise to
please even the readers of <cite>The Daily Mail</cite>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as we have already shown, commercial printing,
machine printing, industrial printing would have its own proper
goodness if it were studiously plain and starkly efficient. Our quarrel
is not with such a thing but only with the thing that is neither one
nor the other&mdash;neither really mechanically perfect and physically
serviceable nor really a work of art, i.e., a thing made by a man
who, however laughable it may seem to men of business, loves God
and does what he likes, who serves his fellow men because he is
wrapped up in serving God&mdash;to whom the service of God is so
commonplace that it is as much bad form to mention it as among
men of business it is bad form to mention profits.</p>

<p>There are, then, two typographies, as there are two worlds; and,
apart from God or profits, the test of one is mechanical perfection,
and of the other sanctity&mdash;the commercial article at its best is
simply physically serviceable and, per accidens, beautiful in its
efficiency; the work of art at its best is beautiful in its very substance
and, per accidens, as serviceable as an article of commerce.</p>

<p>The typography of Industrialism, when it is not deliberately diabolical
and designed to deceive, will be plain; and in spite of the
wealth of its resources&mdash;a thousand varieties of inks, papers, presses
and mechanical processes for the reproduction of the designs of
tame designers&mdash;it will be entirely free from exuberance and fancy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[Pg 264]</span>
Every sort of ornament will be omitted; for printers' flowers will
not spring in such a soil, and fancy lettering is nauseating when it is
not the fancy of type-founders and printers but simply of those who
desire to make something appear better than it is. Paradoxical
though it be, the greater the wealth of appliances, the less is the
power of using it. All the while that the technical and mechanical
good quality is increasing, the de-humanizing of the workmen is also
increasing. As we become more and more able to print finer and
more elaborate and delicate types of letter it becomes more and
more intellectually imperative to standardize all forms and obliterate
all elaborations and fancifulness. It becomes easier and easier to
print any kind of thing, but more and more imperative to print
only one kind.</p>

<p>On the other hand, those who use humane methods can never
achieve mechanical perfection, because the slaveries and standardizations
of Industrialism are incompatible with the nature of men.
Humane Typography will often be comparatively rough and even
uncouth; but while a certain uncouthness does not seriously matter
in humane works, lack of uncouthness is the only possible excuse for
the productions of the machine. So while in an industrialist society
it is technically easy to print any kind of thing, in a humane society
only one kind of thing is easy to print, but there is every scope for
variety and experiment in the work itself. The more elaborate and
fanciful the industrial article becomes, the more nauseating it becomes&mdash;elaboration
and fancifulness in such things are inexcusable.
But there is every excuse for elaboration and fancy in the works
of human beings, provided that they work and live according to
reason; and it is instructive to note that in the early days of printing,
when human exuberance had full scope, printing was characterized
by simplicity and decency; but that now, when such exuberance no
longer exists in the workman (except when he is not at work),
printing is characterized by every kind of vulgarity of display and
complicated indecency.</p>

<p>But, alas for humanity, there is the thing called compromise; and
the man of business who is also the man of taste, and he of taste also
who is also man of business will, in their blameless efforts to earn a
living (for using one's wits is blameless, and earning a living is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[Pg 265]</span>
necessary), find many ways of giving a humane look to machine-made
things or of using machinery and the factory to turn out, more
quickly and cheaply, things whose proper nature is derived from
human labor. Thus we have imitation "period" furniture in Wardour
Street, and we have imitation "arts and crafts" in Tottenham
Court Road. The-man-of-business-who-is-also-man-of-taste will tend
to the "period" work, the-man-of-taste-who-is-also-man-of-business
will tend to the imitation handicrafts. And, in the printing
world, there are business houses whose reputation is founded on
their resuscitations of the eighteenth century, and private presses
whose speed of output is increased by machine-setting and gas engines.
These things are more deplorable than blameworthy. Their
chief objectionableness lies in the fact that they confuse the issue
for the ordinary uncritical person, and they turn out work which is
neither very good nor very bad. "Period" printing looks better
than the usual vulgar products of unrestrained commercialism, and
there is no visible difference, except to the expert, between machine-setting
and hand-setting, or between sheets worked on a hand-press
and those turned out on a power-driven Platen.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, even if these things be difficult to decide in individual
instances, there can be no sort of doubt but that as industrialism
requires a different sort of workman so it also turns out a
different kind of work&mdash;a workman sub-human in his irresponsibility,
and work inhuman in its mechanical perfection. The imitation
of the work of pre-industrial periods cannot make any important
ultimate difference; the introduction of industrial methods and
appliances into small workshops cannot make such workshops capable
of competition with "big business." But while false standards of
good taste may be set up by "period" work, this "good taste" is
entirely that of the man of business and his customers; it is not at all
that of the hands&mdash;they are in no way responsible for it or affected
by it; on the other hand, the introduction of mechanical methods
into small workshops has an immediate effect on the workmen.
Inevitably they tend to take more interest in the machine and less in
the work, to become machine-minders and to regard wages as the
only reward. And good taste ceases to be the result of the restraint
put upon his conscience by the workman himself; it becomes a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[Pg 266]</span>
thing imposed upon him by his employer. You cannot see the
difference between a machine-set page and one set by hand. No, but
you can see the difference between Cornwall before and after it
became "the English Riviera"; you can see the difference between
riding in a hansom and in a motor-cab&mdash;between a "cabby" and a
"taxi-man"; you can see the difference between the ordinary issue
of <cite>The Times</cite> today and its ordinary issue a hundred years ago; you
can see the difference between an ordinary modern book and an
ordinary book of the sixteenth century. And it is not a question of
better or worse; it is a question of difference simply. Our argument
here is not that Industrialism has made things worse, but that it has
inevitably made them different; and that whereas before Industrialism
there was one world, now there are two. The nineteenth
century attempt to combine Industrialism with the Humane was necessarily
doomed, and the failure is now evident. To get the best out of
the situation we must admit the impossibility of compromise; we
must, in as much as we are industrialists, glory in Industrialism and
its powers of mass-production, seeing that good taste in its products
depends upon their absolute plainness and serviceableness; and in so
much as we remain outside Industrialism, as doctors, lawyers,
priests and poets of all kinds must necessarily be, we may glory in
the fact that we are responsible workmen and can produce only one
thing at a time.</p>

<p>That if you look after goodness and truth beauty will take care of
itself, is true in both worlds. The beauty that Industrialism properly
produces is the beauty of bones; the beauty that radiates from the
work of men is the beauty of the living face.</p>

<p class="p22 center small1">The Syracuse University School of Journalism awarded its first medal of honor
to F. W. G. in 1936, "for distinctive achievement in typographic design." His
address then, reflecting the typographic philosophy and practice of two-score
years, is reprinted as published by the University in 1936.</p>

<p>It would be mere affectation on my part were I to pretend not to
be touched by the signal honor you extend to me this evening,
and I would be ungrateful indeed if I neglected to voice my very
great appreciation of your kindness. I wish that I might express that
appreciation in words that would leave no shadow of doubt in your
minds as to the depth and sincerity of my feeling.</p>

<p>I am not conscious of any outstanding reasons for the kind words
spoken here tonight of my work. At the same time I am under no
illusions as to the ultimate value of the work I have <em>attempted</em> to do,
although it is, after all, merely the every-day work of an earnest
craftsman who endeavors to perform each task well and the next one,
if possible, even better; and withal no thought or expectation of
acclaim.</p>

<p>My craft is a simple one. For nearly two score years it has been
my constant aim and endeavor to create a greater and more general
esteem for printing and type design; to give to printers and readers
of print more legible and more beautiful types than those in current
use. This has involved some little sacrifice; the missionary seldom
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[Pg 268]</span>acquires much more than the satisfaction of work well done, and yet,
on the whole, I haven't done badly, since my work has brought me
a wealth of friendship beyond measure.</p>

<p>And now to the subject which has been assigned to me for this
occasion&mdash;something about types of the past, type revivals, and a
bit about type design, as I see it. I trust you will not find that my
brief postprandial attempt bears out Gay's lines too literally:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p><em>So comes the reckoning when the banquet's o'er,<br />
A dreadful reckoning, when men smile no more.</em></p>
</div>

<p>One hundred and twelve years ago type design was generally imagined
to be a matter that concerned only the letter cutter. J. Johnson,
author of <cite>Typographia</cite> (published in 1824), wrote of a type face
that the printer needed only to "observe that its shape be perfectly
true, and that it lines or ranges with accuracy, and that by noting
certain mathematical rules the letter cutter may produce Roman characters
of such harmony, grace and symmetry as will please the eye
in reading; and by having their fine strokes and swells blended together
in due proportion, will excite admiration." He says further
that "if the letter stands even and in line, which <em>is the chief good quality
in letter</em>, it makes the face thereof sometimes to pass, though otherwise
ill-shaped." Type design as a profession evidently did not exist
in 1824. And even today many printers are uninformed as to the
various steps that must be taken between the inception of a type
face in the designer's mind and its eventual appearance on the
printed page.</p>

<p>Today the designing of type is practiced by few artists as a separate
craft; it is an humble art at best&mdash;and a minor one. Yet every
user of types demands in them certain artistic qualities, i. e., invention,
novelty, style, beauty, distinction (a few insist on legibility);
most of those users forget or do not realize that these are qualities an
artist only may secure, and even the artist cannot always insure that
his design will present all of them.</p>

<p>First: Invention requires that we soar above mere caprices of fashion
or the demands of passing fancy. Our letter forms have become
fixed in their essentials by long use and tradition, yet a study of all
that has gone before will enable the designer seeking new expres<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[Pg 269]</span>sions
to infuse new life and character into traditional shapes and
inspire him to create new designs based on the broad impressions
stored in the granary of his mind.</p>

<p>Second: Novelty gives us some new impression suited to and
brought about by new conditions of life and environment&mdash;by the
changes that time has wrought. By novelty I do not mean, however,
the imitation novelty so frequently met with and presented as something
new; too often it means simply some older thing newly described.
Achieving the fantastic quality reminiscent of the "slimy
trail" of <cite>Art Nouveau</cite>, which you older ones will recall as rampant in
the 1890's, produces freaks of fashion in an attempt to be novel, but
may not, necessarily, always secure the novelty desired. Traditions
of the past need not be disregarded nor overlooked in order to meet
the prejudices of the present.</p>

<p>Just now a seemingly insatiable demand for novelty is giving us
a senseless and ridiculous riot of "beautiful atrocities." The inundation
of freak types is largely due to a revival of some former
products of ignorance bringing in their train new designs even more
bizarre in the attempt to secure "novelty"&mdash;a detestable word used
frequently, I fear, like charity, to cover a multitude of sins. It has no
place in artistic considerations, as a thing that really is good should
be good for all time. Sporadic outbreaks in the name of novelty inevitably
occur from time to time and fortunately have usually only
their little day in the sun before vanishing forever into the limbo of
the forgotten.</p>

<p>I do not wish to imply that novelty itself is undesirable&mdash;by no
means; striving for newness keeps things fresh and alive. It is the
re-presentation of the extraordinarily ugly and bizarre types of the
middle of the last century with no exceptional artistic warrant for
their revival, in an attempt to do something different, that I deprecate.
Newness for its own sake only may not always be worth while.</p>

<p>I find it difficult to speak dispassionately of some of the types advertisers
are using nowadays, because I am too deeply steeped in the
traditions of the past to accept them. I cannot be accused of intolerance,
however. The best art of the designer, the highest skill of the
printer, and the clear, lucid argument of the advertisement writer
must be requisitioned. Yet in much of the typography of today many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[Pg 270]</span>
of the new types display a marked avoidance of everything that is
plain, simple and legible. Why are simplicity and easy readability
no longer esteemed as desirable qualities in print? Why are these
outlandish characters selected? For four hundred years the Roman
types of the early Italian printers have furnished models to suit all
tastes and serve every purpose.</p>

<p>For several years past advertisers and even our magazine and book
printers have somewhat strayed from a definite standard of dignity
and beauty in the quest for novelty. Foreign types, imported to add
a touch of novelty to our advertising (types which, no doubt, are
good enough for the conditions in the bailiwicks that gave them
birth), too frequently impart to print a fantastic or a too fanciful
effect when used under the entirely different conditions found here.
These types are likely to impart to our printing an air of incongruity
displeasing to the trained taste. <cite>En passant</cite>, I am reminded of a suggestion
offered by Reinhardt, the scenic designer: "Do not try to
inspire from foreign ideas. Be interested in them, of course, and they
will help to fertilize your own."</p>

<p>Third: Style is a subtle quality that comes from an intelligent use
of a good tradition renewed and advanced into our own times; it is
a quality inseparable from the tools and materials employed, and is
not to be acquired simply by taking thought or by a determination
to attain it. Style is the living expression controlling both the form
and the vital structure of the vehicle which presents thought in tangible
form&mdash;an intimate and inseparable something in the work of a
craftsman wholly unconscious of style or of any definite aim towards
beauty for itself.</p>

<p>Fourth: Distinction is more difficult to secure, yet, when a type
presents an unassuming simplicity; when it expresses thought in
every detail; when it is clear, elegant, strong; nothing in it that is
loose and vague, no finesse of design, but showing clearly in every
line the spirit the designer has put into the body of his work, that
type can hardly fail of real distinction. To meet the demands of utility
and to preserve also an esthetic standard is the problem the type
designer must attempt to solve. Obviously a large order for a mere
amateur (or even for a professional designer).</p>

<p>As to legibility, I shall not here comment. Everyone knows (or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[Pg 271]</span>
thinks he knows) just what constitutes it; I fear I do not, or I would
never permit myself consciously to make a type that was not the
quintessence of legibility.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I am frequently asked how I design a type face. There are so many
things that lead up to one that it is difficult to give a specific reply.
I once told a student that "I think of a letter and then mark around
the thought." That is hardly real designing. It may be easy to think
of one letter, but to think also of its twenty-five relations which
with it form the alphabet and so to mark around them that they will
combine in complete harmony and rhythm with each other and with
all&mdash;that is the difficult thing, the successful doing of which constitutes
design. What is the inspiration for a new face? That also is
difficult to answer. In the first place, it is hardly possible to create
an absolutely new type or one that will not be reminiscent of the
past.</p>

<p>It is quite within the province of the letter artist to take his inspiration
for a new face from any source&mdash;the lapidary inscriptions
of the first centuries of the Imperial age of Rome; a mediaeval brass
that marks the last resting place of a departed ruler; a manuscript
letter by some unsung scribe of the Renaissance, or an early type of
the golden age of typography. Or maybe he may even strive to put
into tangible form on his drawing board some vision from out of
nowhere&mdash;the realization of a chance thought straying through an
idle reverie which he will whip into a satisfactory medium of intellectual
exchange. On the other hand, he may prefer to attempt the
re-creation of new letter from the bones of a more ancient form, endeavoring
to secure in it a new expression of life and vigor, with
new graces suited to our times and our use.</p>

<p>If the designer chooses to disregard old types and go direct to their
source, the manuscript hands of the scribes, well, why not? By revising
their forms, refining them, eliminating their whimsicalities and
vagaries and formalizing their irregularities, he may meet, too, the
mechanical requirements and technical limitations of type founding.
This, probably, is the more legitimate method, since in this way he
will inspire from the real beginnings of our lower case forms. For
myself I am inclined to agree with a writer who maintains that "it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[Pg 272]</span>
is doubtful whether the type designer benefits from a close study of
hand lettering," meaning of course the manuscript hands of the past.
Interesting as old manuscripts are, I find them of little practical use
as offering models for new types. Speaking for myself only I find it
more feasible to get my inspirations from a study of the earlier types
that appeal to me. They frequently offer opportunity for new expression.
With no attempt to copy their particular forms, or to make
changes merely in weight or serif, I endeavor rather to tear from
them the qualities and the spirit that makes them good, for incorporation
in my own letter shapes.</p>

<p>I realize, of course, that the letters I may select as my models were,
without doubt, inspired by some manuscript hand that personally
I may find offers little for use in my own work. With complete independence
of calligraphy I attempt, instead, to secure the negative
quality of unpretentiousness; I strive for the pure contour and monumental
character of the classic lapidary forms of the first centuries
of the Christian era; I endeavor in my work to avoid any bizarre
quality or exhibition of conscious preciosity. (It has been said that
in this latter aim I sometimes fail.)</p>

<p>Once in a while a type face by some other designer seems to present
an interesting movement or quality that I like. I take early opportunity
to make it mine, frankly and openly, in the same way that
a writer might use exactly the same words as another, but by a new
arrangement of them present a new thought, a new idea, or a new
subtlety of expression. Or as two painters using identical tools and
colors, each might produce a masterpiece, yet the work of one probably
would not resemble that of the other in any detail. By copying
carefully a few characters of the type that appeals to me drawn by
another hand, I try to secure in my own drawings some certain
movement or rhythm his may present. I soon discard my model and
proceed from there, as it were, under my own steam, and sometimes
produce a face which my good friend Kent Currie says "has an acid,
typy quality" and (in substance) that it is regular and well-ordered,
that it has interest, color, movement, and sometimes quaintness.</p>

<p>Several years ago I accepted a commission to make a type for a
magazine of large circulation. At that time it was my practice to
make drawings from which matrices were engraved for me by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[Pg 273]</span>
late Robert Wiebking of Chicago. His death occurred just about the
time I was to send him my originals for translation into "mats" from
which to cast the type. In order to carry out my arrangement with
the magazine, and finding difficulty in procuring the work elsewhere,
I determined to try doing also the mechanical work of matrix
engraving myself. Like Moxon, I "learnt it of my own genuine inclination,"
with no previous instruction in the craft. With no engraving
or casting plant ready to my hand I began the getting together
of the various paraphernalia of a type foundry. Procuring machines
for a type foundry was comparatively simple; the operation of
them, making patterns for use in the engraving machines, the lining
and fitting of the cast types, etc., all after I had reached my sixtieth
birthday, was something else. Looking back, I am amazed at my
temerity. It was literally a case of rushing in where angels might
well fear to tread. Yet, since that time I have engraved many hundreds
of matrices.</p>

<p>And now, one other personal note. It is my credo. For nearly two
score years I have made use and beauty the great <em>desiderata</em>. I have
never permitted myself intentionally to utilize the message I was
attempting to present, to serve as a mere framework or scaffolding
upon which to exploit my own skill, nor ever to allow my craft to
became an end in itself instead of a means only to a desirable and
useful end.</p>

<small>A FRIENDLY DISPUTE BETWEEN JUVENIS AND SENEX</small></h2>

<p class="p1 center big1">with a note by FREDERIC W. GOUDY</p>


<p class="p22 center small1">Published by The Village Press, Marlboro, New York, 1933.</p>

<p><em>Juvenis</em>: What is it that you admire in the types of old books?
Don't you love them more for their quaintness than for their
beauty? I have seen originals or accredited facsimiles of the
best books of Gutenberg, Jenson, Aldus, Kerver, Caxton, and
other notable printers, but I prefer modern types.</p>

<p><em>Senex</em>: Then you have seen the pointed black-letter, the round
gothic, the aldine Italic, the flemish black, and the early Roman.
Did not any of these styles please you?</p>

<p><em>Juvenis</em>: Not one. To try to read the pointed black of Gutenberg
and Kerver is as repelling as a walk through the crypts of an
old church; the round gothics are as scraggy as a heap of oyster
shells; the Aldine italics are squeezed as to width, elongated as
to height, and incongruously mated with absurdly small capitals;
the flemish black-letter is the 'tour de force' of a literary acrobat.
In all these characters I see bad drawing and disregard of proportion.
The founding is as bad as the design; some characters are
fitted too near, others too wide, and many letters are out of
line.</p>

<p><em>Senex</em>: You surely cannot censure Jenson's Roman for bad fitting?</p>

<p><em>Juvenis</em>: I do except that, for Jenson was a good mechanic, and
so was Kerver. Their types are well fitted and neatly lined. But
I have small praise to give Jenson for his much admired Roman
letter. Better, no doubt, than any other Roman of the period, but
was it perfection? Bibliophiles forget that this Jenson Roman
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[Pg 275]</span>was out of fashion fifty years after his death, and that his models
have been altered by every succeeding punch-cutter.</p>

<p><em>Senex</em>: How, then, can you explain the favor shown to the
recent types of William Morris? His 'Golden' type is based on
the Jenson model; his 'Troy' and 'Chaucer' types are modeled
after the round gothic of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p><em>Juvenis</em>: I do not pretend to explain freaks of fashion in typography
any more than in religion or art or music. The Athenians
who worshiped an unknown or forgotten god have successors
in every generation. There are Englishmen, nursed in the Catechism,
who try to be devout Buddhists; there are Impressionists,
Pre-Raphaelites, and Wagnerians.</p>

<p>The lover of singularity who can invent nothing that is new
must hunt up something that is old, or at least odd, to keep up
his reputation for discernment. It is enough for me to know
that the literary world, outside of Germany, moved by common
impulse, discarded all the early types. The sacred black-letter
of Gutenberg, and other forms, went to oblivion for good reason.
All were of bad form and hard to read&mdash;obscured by abbreviations,
misuse of capital letters, absurd divisions, and inconsistent
orthography. Much as a student of our time may profess admiration
for early typography, he will not consult the 'Bible of
Forty-two Lines' for a disputed text, when a more readable edition
is accessible.</p>

<p><em>Senex</em>: You confound two features of typography that should
be kept separate. The shapes of early types should be considered
apart from the skill, or want of skill, in their compositors. The
black-letter types of the fifteenth century are often fair copies
of the admirable manuscripts of the period.</p>

<p><em>Juvenis</em>: The black-letter of every early printer was but a servile
copy of the manuscript most attainable. Malformations were
copied, but the flowing graces of penmanship could not be reproduced
in mechanically square types. No punch-cutter of the
period improved on the manuscript copy. All the early books
abound in infelicities of design and cutting, indicating that the
work was not as thoughtfully done as similar work is done now.
It is a begging of the question to assume that the early punch-cutters
were demigods in art. To say that they were right is to
say that Albrecht Dürer and Geoffroy Tory, who wrote books on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[Pg 276]</span>
the true proportions of letters, and Granjon and Garamond, who
gave a lifetime to type-making, were wrong. I prefer to accept
the teachings of known artists as of higher authority.</p>

<p><em>Senex</em>: Is not the difficulty of reading old black-letter due to its
unfamiliar abbreviations and to mannerisms in type-setting now
out of fashion? Would not modern types be obscure if similarly
treated?</p>

<p><em>Juvenis</em>: They would; but the fault begins with the shapes of
the printed letters. You note it in the modern German fraktur,
always a perplexity to every English-born student. The Germans
themselves practically admit its inferiority. Their scientific
books are usually in Roman. Their preference for Roman is a confession
that Roman types are better, and that the printers of the
seventeenth century did wisely in their general abandonment of
pointed letters. The reading world had outgrown them. Why
should we revive them?</p>

<p><em>Senex</em>: Let us not trouble ourselves about pointed letters. There
is no probability that they will ever be accepted by Americans
for the texts of ordinary books. Let us consider the Roman types
that have been in use by the Latin races and by English-speaking
people for three centuries. Are modern types as readable as those
of Jenson? Here is his Pliny of 1472, and here is the 'soprasilvio'
of Bodoni, as exhibited in his <cite>Manuale Tipografico</cite> of 1818.
Which is better?</p>

<p><em>Juvenis</em>: I am surprised at the question. Every character in the
Bodoni type is correctly drawn; every system of uniform thickness,
every hair-line and serif sharp as a knife-edge. Curves are
true and graceful, angles exact; fitting and lining beyond criticism.
In the Jenson type there is not one perfect letter. The
hair-lines are scant and of unequal thickness, the serifs are stubby,
the stems of uneven width, the characters out of proportion.
Raggedness of drawing and roughness of cutting are not concealed
by its fairly good fitting and lining. No publisher of the
last two centuries would dare to print, and no reader consent
to buy, a contemporary book in this type.</p>

<p><em>Senex</em>: Can you not see something more in this Jenson type? Is
it not more readable? I put them side by side at a distance of ten
feet, where you can read the Jenson and cannot read the Bodoni.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p><em>Juvenis</em>: True: but types in great primer are not made to be read
at ten feet distance.</p>

<p><em>Senex</em>: True again; but the mannerisms that obscure the Bodoni
type at ten feet are more distressing in his small types, usually
read at the distance of fifteen inches. The over-sharp hair-line,
the dazzling serif, and the vanishing curve are more irritating in
the smaller than in the larger sizes. Ordinary eyesight does not
seize at a glance the entire face of modern type; it dimly sees
hair-lines or serifs; it deciphers the stems only; it sees but half
of the letter, and guesses at the invisible. The type of Bodoni is
a wearying strain on the eye.</p>

<p><em>Juvenis</em>: Your remarks do not fairly apply to readers of good
sight.</p>

<p><em>Senex</em>: They do apply to the majority of readers. It is a mistake
to make for ordinary texts types with lines that cannot be easily
seen by all.</p>

<p><em>Juvenis</em>: If you think boldness of most importance in a type, why
make Jenson's type your model? Why not go back still farther?
Why not take up the lapidary letters of old Rome, Greece, or
Etruria?</p>

<p><em>Senex</em>: They are uncouth and wasteful of space. Designed to
be chiseled on stone, they are unfit for types. The 'Caroline
minuscule,' which is the basis of our Roman text letter, is more
compact, quite as irregular, and much more readable.</p>

<p><em>Juvenis</em>: If you believe that there was a gradual improvement
in the shapes of letters between the first and fifteenth centuries,
why stop at the fifteenth? Why not admit that this improvement
continues?</p>

<p><em>Senex</em>: Because the changes that followed were not always improvements.
The faultless curves, sharp lines, and exact angles
of Bodoni were disfigurements made at the expense of readability.
Types are made to be easily read, not to show the skill of the
designer. When they fail in readability the fault is fatal. The
proper development of typography was checked by the invention
of copper-plate that trod on its heels. Its delicacy of line,
its perfect graduation of shadows, its vigorous blacks, and its
facile rendering of a receding perspective put out of fashion all
strong and manly work on wood. Dürer's 'Little Passion,' Hol<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[Pg 278]</span>bein's
'Dance of Death,' and Vostre's <cite>Book of Hours</cite> were put
aside, and the insipid effeminacies of overworked line-engraving
took their place. Punch-cutters of the sixteenth century thought
that printing would be improved if they imitated the methods
of line-engravers, and so they cut their types sharper and thinner.
They would not see that relief engraving and incised engraving
are diametrically opposed in theory and practice, and that the
imitation of one process by the other is impossible. Repeated
failures did not check this desire to imitate. Increasing refinements
in types produced a corresponding degradation in printing.
The inferiority of the average book of the eighteenth century
is largely due to the so-called 'improved' faces of type. The most
irrepressible imitator of copper-plate effects was Bodoni of
Parma. William Morris is right in saying that his imitations of
copper-plate delicacy indicate a real abasement of the typographic
art.</p>

<p><em>Juvenis</em>: If correct drawing, exact proportion, and high finish
are merits in other arts, why should they be faults in type-making?</p>

<p><em>Senex</em>: 'Finish' is a merit only when it improves; when it over-elaborates,
when it leads the reader to think more of the means
employed than of the object sought, it is a fault. Bodoni's careful
drawing and finical cutting defeat the purpose for which types
were made. They do not fully show the letter; they do show
Bodoni; and it is a fair supposition that he was more intent on
showing his skill than he was on aiding the reader. Your ideal
of merit in types is that of mechanical precision. You forget that
letters are of irregular shapes, with intent to make them distinct.
The more you prune away the irregularities, the more indistinct
they become. Readers do not isolate and critically examine each
letter; they read words at a glance. They prefer characters with
enough of irregularity to arrest the eye and fix the thought of
the writer. It is with types as with penmanship. Has it been your
misfortune to revise a long manuscript written in feminine style
with a crow-quill pen, and with admirable precision, but with
almost invisible hair strokes? Recollect your exasperation at its
mechanical precision and wearisome monotony. How gratefully
you turned to a jagged and masculine but readable style of penmanship,
in which you were content to have all the rules of
writing-masters violated! Recall these experiences, and then un<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[Pg 279]</span>derstand
why I prefer old types. Not because they are old, or
of faultless form, but because the letters are more distinct. They
were made, not to show the skill of the punch-cutter, but to
help the reader; and they deserve the credit due to straightforward
workmanship.</p>


<p class="p1 center">A NOTE BY FREDERIC W. GOUDY</p>

<p><em>In 1898 the name "De Vinne" meant little more to me than the
name of a then popular display printing type, until the day, in a
book-shop in Detroit, I chanced on a copy of</em> The Book-lover's
Almanac <em>for 1896. Of the eight or ten articles listed in the table of
contents one was by Theo. Low De Vinne. The article was written
in the form of a discussion between "Senex" and "Juvenis"
on the comparative merits of the early type faces and those of
Bodoni and his successors. This was, I believe, my first realization
that "De Vinne" was the name of a living personality.</em></p>

<p><em>I was just becoming interested in the history of the typography
of books and was making also a closer study of type design, but
it did not occur to me that such study would ever lead to the
actual practise of the art I have since made peculiarly my own....</em></p>

<p><em>When I first read Mr. De Vinne's article it seemed to me that
"Senex" had rather the better of the argument, indeed, I have not
found, during the nearly two score years that have elapsed, any
statements elsewhere that have changed materially the opinions
then formed as to the soundness of his asseverations....</em></p>

<p><em>If I were asked to say what I think has been the greatest single
influence in my work as a type designer I would be hard put to
find a satisfactory reply; but there is no doubt in my mind that
the principles set forth in this article and in his book</em> Notable
Printers of Italy During the 15th Century <em>have certainly loomed
large in crystallizing the character of my types. The consistency
of thought he displayed, his sound knowledge of old types, his
fairness in the consideration of each moot point, the simple yet
lucid presentation of his ideas and opinions interested me; they
influenced my own thought, and in turn are reflected in my work.</em></p>

<p><em>If, to my more mature consideration of this discussion there is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[Pg 280]</span>
any lapse of the author's pen, it seems to me it is, that "Senex"
failed to stress more strongly a demand for greater grace and
beauty in types in closer combination with legibility. I feel that
the proper standard of beauty in types basically resides in their
utility, but there are, nevertheless, secondary esthetic attributes
which may be included without any sacrifice of life and vigor
and legibility. A certain rugged beauty is perceived without
difficulty, and irregularities which in isolated or individual characters,
might seem objectionable from the standpoint of grace
alone, may prove highly desirable in the composed line. Readability
is of course to be considered above every other quality,
because, failing this it fails utterly, regardless of every other
excellence; yet, while striving for legibility, beauty of form
should also be given almost equal consideration.... I venture to
disagree with Senex's statement that "the lapidary letters of old
Rome are uncouth and ... unfit for types"....</em></p>

<p class="p22 center small1">From <cite>Paragraphs on Printing</cite>. Copyright 1943 by William E. Rudge's Sons. Reprinted by
permission of author and publisher</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p><em>NOTE: The text for this book on the functions of the book designer was
elicited from B.R. in talks with James Hendrickson. These informal observations
on typographical problems were accompanied by numerous reproductions
of pages of Mr. Rogers' design, by way of illustration and example.</em></p>
</div>


<p>You think of the <em>book</em>, the size and shape of the book,
before you consider type or anything else. What kind of a
volume should it be? In what particular form and in what face
of type would <em>you</em> like to read it? The type and format should
be governed by your conception of the character of the subject
matter. As an instance take Conrad's tale, <cite>The Tremolino</cite>,
recently printed. It is a slight but vivid story, to be read almost
at a glance, so it would have been a misfit to make it
larger, say in octavo size. The vividness is indicated by the
dramatic little cuts in color, the slightness by the dimensions
and open character of the pages.</p>

<p>After the size is determined the selection of a suitable type
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[Pg 282]</span>comes next. And that depends usually on what types are
available in the office in which the book is to be made. Even
this is not always necessary, as many offices have composition
done outside by type-composition firms, so that an almost
unlimited choice may be yours. There are so many varieties of
type now, that for almost any size or kind of book you plan
you will readily find an appropriate face. At any rate it isn't
so vitally important as other things.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is a great advantage in laying out a page, especially a title
or display page, if the designer can handle pen or pencil; and
the more definitely he can represent the type he proposes to
use, the greater saving of time and expense there will be when
it comes to the setting of it. It is true that some masters of
printing do not resort to sketching&mdash;at least not more than
mere lines on the paper, labeled with the kinds and sizes of
type they represent. But to visualize the completed page in
such slight indications is an unusual gift, and if one does not
possess this gift there is the probability that the first setting
of the page will have to be torn apart several times before a
satisfactory one is produced. It is sometimes well worth while
to work a page out very carefully, even in pen-and-ink, so that
it will be a pretty close approximation to the finished thing;
especially if you have to submit the scheme to a customer for
his approval, or if he asks to see alternative treatments.</p>

<p>Of course, after many years of familiarity with type faces,
it isn't necessary to draw them accurately for your own guidance,
even though you should possess that ability; but some
nevertheless find it a pleasant thing to see the page take form
under their pencil or pen before it goes into actual type.
Frequently, however, there is a sense of disappointment in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[Pg 283]</span>
seeing the first type proof, for the freedom and swing of your
sketch has usually vanished in its translation into type; and
the more formal the style of type the less it will retain the
quality of your sketch.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Making an "allusive" format for a book&mdash;that is, casting
it in the style of the period of the original text&mdash;is in a small
way something like planning the stage setting for a play. An
up-to-date style for an ancient text would compare with staging
<cite>Hamlet</cite> in modern dress. However novel and effective in
its own way, you feel it to be strange, and this sense of strangeness
is an annoying distraction; you are forced to think of the
setting and the designer rather than of the text.</p>

<p>The character of the text to be printed is of course the first
thing to consider in selecting the kind of type; and the number
of pages to which the book will probably run is the determining
factor as to what size of type is possible. The width
and length of the type page are then to be proportioned to the
paper page, which in turn also helps to determine the size of
the type. All these considerations are interlocking.</p>

<p>There have been several rules formulated for page proportions.
One is that the width of the page should approximate
one-half of the diagonal. Another is that the length of line
should be one-half more than the length of a line of the
twenty-six lower-case letters of the type used. But all such
rules are only guides, to be discarded when the effect you are
after seems to require something else; this something else to
be determined only by the judgment of the designer and his
feeling for the appearance of the page. In the reproduction of
the styles of early typography the designer should avoid setting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[Pg 284]</span>
small type in too wide a measure. The old printers in their
folio volumes did not seem to mind very long lines of comparatively
small type. But most of these ancient books in
Roman type were never intended for rapid reading. They were
generally Latin texts where the eye follows the line better
than in English or French composition. Latin composition
naturally makes more beautiful pages on account of the preponderance
of short letters&mdash;m, n, u, etc., with comparatively
few ascenders and descenders. The evenness of spacing that
the early printers got came from their abundant use of Latin
abbreviations and their indifference as to how many consecutive
word divisions occurred at the ends of lines, but it was
never a conscious effort to obtain what is called "texture" in
the page. There should be no laboring to produce a perfectly
spaced page but rather an endeavor to avoid a badly spaced one.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The amount of leading that a page requires depends on so
many factors that it is difficult to give any fixed method of
procedure. The kind of type, the size of type, the length of
line and the general character of the text all bear on this point.
Generally speaking, most types should be at least slightly
leaded, especially if the lines are fairly long. This helps the
eye to catch the following line in rapid reading more easily
than when the type is set solidly. The solid pages were usually
adopted when old-style types were used exclusively; but when
modern type came in, beginning with Bodoni, the custom of
leading, sometimes double-leading, arose. The effect of these
new types was helped by a generous amount of white paper
between the lines. This applies to Bodoni, Bulmer, and the
Scotch face and their derivatives. Antique types were, however,
occasionally very freely leaded, especially in Spanish
books of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>The conventional use of quotation marks is to place a
double mark at the beginning and end of the passage quoted,
with single marks for any quotations within it. In books with
much conversation the use of double quotes frequently results
in very mottled typography, and for many years some English
printers have adopted the single mark for the major quotations,
using double marks only if an inner quote occurs. This
violates, a little, one's sense of relative importance, but in a
book where there are only simple quotations there is no reason
why the single mark should not suffice, much to the visual
improvement of the typography. There is some possibility of
confusion if the last word of the extract should chance to be a
possessive plural, with an apostrophe, as the two marks are
identical; but this occurs so infrequently as to be negligible.</p>

<p>Inverted commas were used for opening quotes in most
founts until comparatively recent years, but now a separate
pattern is provided for most founts. Reversed, instead of
inverted commas now accompany many founts, particularly
the reproductions of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century
types, at which time they were first introduced.</p>

<p>French, Spanish and other continental founders furnish a
special design of marks, « »; but these look rather strange to
Anglo-Saxon eyes.</p>

<p>In Elizabethan printing the quotation marks sometimes ran
entirely down the margins of the extracts, and if, as was frequently
the case, the page was enclosed with rules, they were
often placed outside the rules. This treatment occurs in one
of the handsomest books of that period, <cite>Nobilitas Politica vel
Civilis</cite>, printed in 1608 by William Jaggard, the printer of the
First Folio fifteen years later. The <cite>Nobilitas</cite> is generally accounted
the masterpiece of his press, and in itself comprises
nearly all of the various typographical features of books of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[Pg 286]</span>
that time. Large and small types, Roman, Italic, black-letter
and Anglo-Saxon, both solid and leaded pages, tabular work
with handsome braces, side notes, woodcut initials, head-pieces
and tailpieces, and a series of costume plates engraved
on copper and printed within the rules on folioed blank pages
left for them in the form&mdash;all go toward making a book that
is a compendious example for students of Elizabethan
typography.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Red is the most satisfactory secondary color with black,
and you will often find that it is better to use just one spot
of color on the page. In using red for an occasional display
line, blue-red or purple-red or orange-red should be avoided.
A red such as the early printers had, a full-bodied, rather dull
vermilion, which will hold up well with the black, is the most
successful. If it is desirable to employ the blue for a border or
an initial it shows up much more brilliantly when the design
is in white on a solid or stippled ground of the blue. An outline
design in blue is too light in mass to accompany the
black of the type. But black and blue alone are never so pleasing
a combination as when red is introduced as the second
color, with blue as the third.</p>

<p>The black for the text or reading types should be intense
without being glossy, because the gloss causes a reflection of
light and interferes with legibility. The same objection does
not apply to colors, for a moderate gloss enriches them and
overcomes a sort of dustiness that their surfaces take on.</p>

<p>The text pages of most books should be printed in black
ink.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The tendency of a young printer is often to try for
novelty by printing with color rather than with black, not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[Pg 287]</span>realizing that most types were not designed for anything but
black on white. If, however, the job is somewhat aside from
the usual run of books, and is not of too great extent, a
brown or green ink may be substituted for black if the tint
be dark enough to afford perfect legibility. But the result then
acquires something of the character of an object of art rather
than a book.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Letter-spacing is often misused. It is safe to say that lower-case
type should practically <em>never</em> be letter-spaced, for the individual
letters were designed for close combination with other
letters of the alphabet. If it becomes necessary to fill out a line it
is preferable to put all the extra space between the words even
though the resultant "holes" are distressing to the eye. Sometimes
with very large types it is permissible to letter-space in
a minor degree, as the spaces between the letters naturally are
larger and letter-spacing does not detract too much from the
appearance of the line, especially if it is distributed according
to the irregular space between the different letters as normally
set.</p>

<p>With capitals or upper-case letters the conditions are different.
Then it is frequently a great advantage to use letter-spaces,
even considerably; but this depends upon the general
style of the typography adopted for the book. In the hands of
some contemporary printers the Aldine practice of wide letter-spacing
of small capitals has been followed quite skilfully
in title- or subtitle lines, chapter headings, and other display
work. This is of particular advantage with the rather heavy-faced
modern types, i.e., Scotch, Bodoni, etc.</p>

<p>It is well to avoid too many, and too open letter-spaced
lines in any kind of display composition, for the effect is
sometimes disastrous. Baskerville was very fond of letter-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[Pg 288]</span>spacing
and most of his work is, in that respect, extremely
ugly.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> He sometimes pushed spacing to the point of absurdity;
notably in his great Bible, where in the heading of the
Book of Job he set the letters J O B in capitals of about
48-point size with three inches of space between them. It
could hardly be called a word, but rather just a bad job of
type-setting.</p>

<p>The practice of letter-spacing to produce blocked-out lines
of capitals must be done with great caution and skill or else a
very uneven texture will be produced. Frequently it is better
to abandon the idea of a block of type if the spacing cannot
be done with a fairly uniform effect. It is a mistake to start
with a determination to produce a block of type and then to
persist in it at any cost of legibility or appearance. When lines
of capitals are set without leading, letter-spacing should never
be used. The leading should be in proportion to the spacing
in order to keep the continuity of the lines of type, otherwise
you will produce columns of letters instead of lines. It is
hardly necessary to say that the best letter-spacing is not done
with uniform spaces between the letters. The spacing on
either side of a letter should be determined by the shape of
the adjacent letters. Most compositors have now learned to
use spaces according to the shape of the letters, but the cutting
of such letters as V, W, to make them set closer than their
natural width is usually very much overdone. The new logotypes
cut for this purpose are equally faulty in this respect.
The resulting effect is more noticeable and more objectionable
than the natural setting of the type would be. Anything
that strikes the eye as strange or unusual in a line of type is
to be avoided.</p>

<p>Periods and commas of letter-spaced capitals should not be
set off from the last letter of the word, regardless of the
amount of spacing used elsewhere in the line.</p>

<p>Colons and semicolons have traditionally been set apart
from the word they follow, whether in capitals or lower case.
In old books they are frequently centered in the space between
the words where they occur. Exclamation and interrogation
points should if possible be set off with thin spaces because
they often form disagreeable and confusing combinations
with the last letter of the word, such as ff!, ll!, f?, etc.</p>

<p class="p22 center centaur small1">Revised and amended from P.M., Vol. II, No. 5, New York, January 1936.</p></div>

<p class="centaur">To anyone who has set or handled type, the achievements of
Bruce Rogers in combining decorative type units to form a
design are extraordinary. This may seem undiluted enthusiasm;
actually and sincerely it is but simple fact.</p>

<p class="centaur">How? Why? Only a detailed examination of a particular
B.R. design with type ornaments will reveal. An examination,
that is, accompanied by simultaneous scanning of a proof of
the individual elements comprising the design. When one
sees the units alone&mdash;some of them so seemingly useless that
one wonders that anything, even second-rate stuff, could
possibly be done with such drab material&mdash;then one appreciates
the typographic magic B.R. has accomplished.</p>

<p class="centaur"><em>How</em> he sees anything in some of the units he uses so
dexterously, I don't know. When and how he first became
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[Pg 291]</span>interested in doing designs with type ornaments is worth
considering.</p>

<p class="centaur">His experiments date back to Riverside Press days, though
in that period no attempts were made to use type ornament
except by conventional combinations into borders or head-pieces.
But even at that time he had several seventeenth-century
flowers recut for the decoration of a collection of early
American documents, titled <cite>Sailors Narratives of Voyages Along
the New England Coast, 1524-1624</cite>, edited by George Parker
Winship.</p>

<p class="centaur">Interest in combining type ornaments was shown again
while at the University Press in Cambridge, England, during
1918-19, but he developed it there into nothing more than
the revival of two or three other earlier ornaments which were
used, as at Riverside, in conventional ways. A page of his
scrapbook shows also a number of trials with Egyptian hieroglyphs,
but apparently nothing came of these.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[Pg 292]</span></p>

<p class="centaur">The germ of his allusive use of ornaments is probably to
be found in the "Goosefest" menu which he concocted at
Carl Rollins' Montague Press; when at the bottom of an
elaborate bill of fare three of Will Bradley's strutting little
figures are set (or laid) flat on their backs in a row, with the
legend, "Turn over (not us but the leaf)."</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp83" id="i292-1" style="max-width: 17.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_292-1.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p class="centaur">The earliest traceable use of ornaments and punctuation
marks that in combination bear directly upon the text thus
decorated was in the heading for the first page of <cite>The Symbol
and the Saint</cite>, where a line of parentheses, a cross and three
dolphins symbolize the overseas quest of the hero of the
tale. This same motif was developed and elaborated later in
<cite>Joseph Conrad the Man</cite>, <cite>The Ancient Mariner</cite>, and other pieces. His
scrapbook shows many unused variations on this theme. The
sea and leaping dolphins and palms seem to be his favorite
preoccupation.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_292-2.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p class="centaur">Probably the most difficult compositions of this kind he
has produced are to be found in Conrad's unfinished novel,
<cite>The Sisters</cite>; where in a space the width of the page and one-quarter
to one-half inch in depth may be found suggestions
of illimitable Russian wheat fields, Paris with its mansard
roofs and French roads leading into it, a farewell scene at
sunset on a winding Spanish road, etc., each based upon some
phrase or paragraph in the story itself.</p>

<p class="centaur">Most certainly B.R.'s accomplishments surpass those
decorative combinations of type ornaments shown in early
printers' and type-founders' specimens&mdash;yes, even including
the foremost achievements of the hallowed rule benders.</p>

<p class="centaur">Little research is necessary to support these rather inclusive
statements. An excellent example is the <cite>Utopia</cite> title page, done
for the Limited Editions Club. Here is swirling movement
in a border, if ever you saw it. And accomplished, mainly,
with two traits of ornament and their reverses. The entire
border took but several more.</p>

<p class="centaur">Setting them out individually, doesn't give a hint of their
possibilities. Yet look at the result of their use by B.R.,
scan the design closely to discover just where and how each
element is placed with such telling effect&mdash;and you begin to
appreciate the man's ability.</p>

<p class="centaur">Another example&mdash;old stuff B.R. will call it&mdash;is the title
page of a little Christmas book issued a dozen years ago by
Rudge. Could one reasonably expect anything remotely approaching
typographic whimsy from a few typographic toy
soldiers, a dog, an elephant, a few Christmas trees, a half
moon and some stars? Just glance at <cite>The Symbol and the Saint</cite> title
page though, and see how B.R.'s subtle skill utilized material
teetering toward the junk pile.</p>

<p class="centaur">"Never," your perceptive collector will say, "has anything
more masterful been done with type ornaments than in the
Grolier Club <cite>Pierrot of the Minute</cite>." Few would disagree, for if
ever there was a typographic jewel, the <cite>Pierrot</cite> is it. Yet B.R.,
in discussing it critically, termed it "French millinery. Probably
all right for its purpose. Rather over-decorated, but then
the poem itself seems over-decorative."</p>

<p class="centaur">There are dozens of other examples of B.R.'s mastery of
typographic decoration. But space is not limitless, and I want
particularly to say something about some designs with Linotype
ornaments (drawn by T. M. Cleland) that Mr. Rogers
devised a few years ago for the Linotype Company. These
were used for the first time in the insert discussing the auction
prices of twenty B.R. books, which appeared in <cite>Barnacles From
Many Bottoms</cite>, several of which are shown on pages 290, 299
and 300.</p>

<p class="centaur">That "something" may best be told, I believe, by excerpts
from letters written to a Company executive, in April and
May 1931, by B.R., who then was in London:</p>

<p class="centaur">"... In an odd hour I got to playing about with some of
the Cleland ornaments, cutting them out of a specimen and
pasting them into a design which finally evolved itself into
several amusing compositions. Later on it occurred to me
that you might be able to use them in some piece....</p>

<p class="centaur">"Having only a limited number of proofs, and no slugs
whatever, I was able to work out the idea in only the roughest
fashion&mdash;not fit to show anyone&mdash;but the principal one of
the designs is for a page heading ... or the elements composing
it could be used singly&mdash;as tail pieces, initial letters, etc.</p>

<p class="centaur">"This probably is an impractical idea [a suggestion by Mr.
Rogers on how the material might be used], but I only make
it to put into action more or less work that I have already
done to save it from the scrap basket&mdash;work that might be
useful to your firm as a demonstration of what can be done
with some of your product. I really don't think anyone has
yet worked out the possibilities of your ornamental material,
much of which is the best on the market."</p>

<p class="centaur">Additional proofs of the Cleland ornaments were sent
immediately to Mr. Rogers in London. With them he made
eight designs, cutting the proofs and pasting the ornaments
to show the desired effect. This tree, for instance, was used
on the title page of the <cite>Barnacles</cite> insert:</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp74" id="i300" style="max-width: 12.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_300.jpg"  alt="" />

<p class="centaur">This was printed from a line engraving made direct from Mr.
Rogers' paste-up, and used "as is" to show how accurately
his layouts for this type of work reach the composing-room.</p>

<p class="centaur">A month later, in May 1931, Mr. Rogers returned his
layouts with this note: "... I have only just been able to
complete the designs I had begun.... One or two other combinations
occurred to me, which I have also put in&mdash;but we
could go on endlessly, almost, when once started on this kind
of thing.... I would have built up the designs with impressions
from sections of a slug, had you sent an inch or two of each
unit; but it is perhaps better, though slower, to cut and paste
proofs, as each cutting is a guide to the compositor as to how
and where trimming or beveling the ornaments are necessary.
But only a few such trimmings are required, and all the bevelings
are at 45 degrees&mdash;as is the diagonal composition of the
oak tree heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p class="centaur">"If at all possible I would like to have a chance to revise
proofs of these, before they are actually printed&mdash;but if that
isn't feasible, then I must rely on the compositors getting the
closest possible approximation to my pasted-up designs. As
close setting as possible is the secret of most work of this
kind. The various parts must hang together well&mdash;though I
do not mind a slight indication at the joints that they are
made of individual pieces of type. I once had an over-zealous
electrotyper fill up all the joints with solder&mdash;and ruined the
appearance of the design&mdash;it looked like a drawn one."</p>

<p class="centaur">It wasn't possible to show Mr. Rogers what had been done
with his layouts for the insert in <cite>Barnacles</cite>, which was essentially
a surprise book distributed as a keepsake at a dinner in
his honor.</p>

<p class="centaur">The "fighting cocks," to cite one instance, were originally
suggested by B.R. to be used to dress a page folio at the bottom
of the page; in the insert they were raised to the top of
the page and printed with his initials. Other slight adaptations
of similar character were taken in that piece of printing.</p>

<p class="centaur">"Typographic whimsy," wrote Carl Purington Rollins in
<cite>B.R.&mdash;America's Typographic Playboy</cite>, in 1927, "is a pretty difficult
achievement. The compositor at the case is too much
concerned with the practical minutiæ of his craft to have
much time for such trivialities, and the man who designs
printing at a draughting board is apt to find his humor, if he
attempts it in type, limping like a thrice-told jest. Mr. Rogers
has had the advantage of enough familiarity with type to know
what can be done, and he has been able at times to work with
compositors who take a large and robust view of their calling."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[Pg 302]</span></p>

<p class="centaur">That "whimsy" Mr. Rollins had reference to lies in many
of B.R.'s more ephemeral efforts, frequently reproduced. It
is reflected to a measure, by <cite>The Symbol and the Saint</cite> page. But
there is considerably more than whimsy in the type ornament
designs by B.R. These have graced dozens of books of varying
subjects ... and the marvel of it all is, to me, that the man
never repeats himself&mdash;he swings off on a new tack ... adventurous,
exploring, mastering new trails, scattering typographic
inspiration for dozens of others, pointing up paths
they previously never even suspected.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="centaur p01"><em>Postscript</em>, 1951: It is fitting to add a note concerning one of
B.R.'s more distinguished recent projects, the great folio
Bible designed for The World Publishing Company, which
was four years in the making.</p>

<p class="centaur">The design of the World Bible employed decorative treatment
for the bordered title page, the sixty-six book openings,
initial letters and numerous tailpieces. "These, together with
the type selected [a revised, special cutting of Goudy New-style],
are intended to give a slightly oriental flavor to the
volume," B.R. pointed out, "indicative of the Syriac and
Hebrew sources of the text on which the King James translators
based their classic version."</p>

<p class="centaur">In discussing the matter of ornaments in the Bible with the
publishers, B.R. revealed his thinking concerning their use:
"... Most of the Books will probably not begin at the top
of the page and the use of ornaments are to me necessary to
separate the end of the preceding book from the title of the
following one.</p>

<p class="centaur">"The Bible has always been a book on which much decoration
and illustrations have been lavished, and there is no
reason in tradition why it should be treated solemnly in that
respect. The very first edition (of which I have specimen
sheets and a whole Bible printed from the same type and with
the same decorations by the same printer, twenty-five years
later, 1635) is just peppered with woodcut decorations and
type ornaments. So we have a good precedent for a decorated
treatment&mdash;if any were needed. You know the Bible is on the
whole one of the most exciting texts in existence, and the
modern 'practical' treatment of it as mainly a book of devotion
is ignoble, to say the least...."</p>

<p class="centaur">Some of the typographic decoration and initials used in the
Bible are included here. William Targ's detailed account, <cite>The
Making of the Bruce Rogers World Bible</cite>, contains most of the decorative
elements&mdash;initials, tailpieces and chapter initials&mdash;and
reveals the intimate story of the progress of the book's production
through the four years. It was published by World in
1949, in a limited edition of 1875 copies, 500 of which were
for sale.</p>

<p>Not very long since I was asked by a printer to what extent
he should accept or avoid modern trends in the design of
types and books. I attempt here to answer that question.</p>

<p>I have a friend, connected with one of the great companies
supplying machines for type composition. Not long since he
spoke to me in unflattering terms of the examples of typography
shown at an exhibition of the products of the Bauhaus
School, originally of Weimar and later of Munich. He protested
against a practice there manifested of discarding capital
letters and depending solely on those in the lower-case. I consoled
him by showing him a French book, printed entirely in
this style. This volume, entitled <cite>Typographie Économique</cite>, was
published in Paris in 1837 and so far as it had any influence on
printing, then or later, is as dead as Queen Anne. The author,
the Count de Lasteyrie, who promoted this scheme, was one
of a race of French scientists, of some intellectual and social
importance&mdash;one of the daughters of Lafayette married into
that family. In the eighteenth century no less a person than
the German writer Grimm tried a similar typographical
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[Pg 307]</span>plan. In the Fairy Tales containing "Snow White and the
Seven Dwarfs," later compiled by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm,
the practice was not continued. This supports the contention
that many new and disturbing experiments, under the patronage
of distinguished names, are merely survivals or revivals
of ancient failures. Thus in the light of experience, there is in
Bauhaus typography nothing for my acquaintance&mdash;or anybody
else&mdash;to be excited about.</p>

<p>Now Bauhaus typography is of the essence of modernism.
That its position may be fairly stated I quote the following from
a <cite>Bauhaus Year Book</cite>:&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">verbatim</i> and (I may add) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">literatim</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>["] why should we write and print with two alphabets? both
a large and a small sign are not necessary to indicate one
single sound.</p>

<p><em>A</em> = <em>a</em></p>

<p>we do not speak a capital A and a small a.</p>

<p>we need only a single alphabet. it gives us practically the
same result as the mixture of upper and lower-case letters,
and at the same time is less of a burden on all who write&mdash;on
school children, students, stenographers, professional and
business men. it could be written much more quickly, especially
on the type-writer, since the shift key would then become
unnecessary, typewriting could therefore be more quickly
mastered and typewriters would be cheaper because of
simpler construction, printing would be cheaper, for fonts
and type cases would be smaller, so that printing establishments
would save space and their clients money. with these
common sense economies in mind ... the bauhaus made a
thorough alphabetical house-cleaning in all its printing,
eliminating capitals from books, posters, catalogs, magazines,
stationery and even calling cards.</p>

<p>dropping capitals would be a less radical reform in english.
indeed the use of capital letters occurs so infrequently in
english in comparison with german that it is difficult to
understand why such a superfluous alphabet should still be
considered necessary.["]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[Pg 308]</span></p></div>

<p>Now in German printing all nouns have capital letters. In
the sentence "A Dog chases a Cat into a Barn," dog, cat,
barn are all capitalized. No one can be blamed for wanting to
be rid of so much capitalization. But when Germans purge
anything the innocent invariably suffer with the guilty. Thus
all capitals must go. While it may have overcome a difficulty
felt in Germany, this imported missionary zeal corrects no
difficulty in the printing of English prose or poetry. In some
instances such a custom brings about surprising results.
Suppose, for example, a newspaper says "the white house
favors black and prefers even green to a dyed-in-the-wool
red." To make the sentence intelligible would need the addition
of a number of words&mdash;which would not be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">typographie
économique</i>! We need labour this point no further but leave
these experiments to the advertising of Coty and Elizabeth
Arden. Such effects have what is called attention value&mdash;like
Neon signs&mdash;but I am not considering that kind of typography.
I have, however, here traced the source of a current
fashion of printing signs and advertisements without capital
letters.</p>

<p>I have been classed by my work as a conservative, but I am
a liberal conservative or a conservative liberal&mdash;whichever
you like or dislike. All I wish to conserve, either in traditionalism
or modernism, is common sense. What little I have
was gained by experience. I regard many typographic experiments
with good will and many traditional viewpoints
with tolerance. I agree wholeheartedly with neither. I remember&mdash;or
try to do so&mdash;that every generation has in turn
to be told that there was once a man named Caesar, who wrote
a very dull book called the <cite>Commentaries</cite>, of which the first
sentence is all that most people remember; that the makers
of Baker's Chocolate did not invent the familiar picture of a
chocolate girl, which was an eighteenth-century painting by
Jean Etienne Liotard now in a Dresden picture gallery, and
that William Blake did not write, but only illustrated, the
Book of Job. We who have long known these things forget
that people are born not knowing them. We should therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[Pg 309]</span>
look tenderly on many typographic experiments. To us
elders they may seem akin to lighting a fire with kerosene or
applying one's tongue to metal in zero temperatures, but it is
by such unwise ventures that we outgrow them. And as I
have spent a long life learning, and to most questions do not
yet know the answers, I have no right to frown on more youthful
and enterprising enquirers.</p>

<p>Obviously some of the eccentricities of present-day typography
are a natural reflection of that rather tortured world in
which we find ourselves. If art, the drama, literature, and
music reflect current trends of life it is natural that printing
should in a measure do so. If we throw overboard old standards
of conduct, we may far more readily throw over old
standards of taste. When one casts a convention away as
useless and outmoded, we often learn for the first time why
it was there! It is urged that fuller expression of individuality,
unhampered by rules, is development. It seems to me more
accurate to say that through the experience of trying these
experiments development comes&mdash;though not always of a
kind expected. Such development ought never to stop until
in the exact sense of the word we are "accomplished"&mdash;finished&mdash;which
few live to be.</p>

<p>The <em>problem</em> is to distinguish between a true development,
and a false one. In judging either modernistic or retrospective
typography, that is what must be decided. Do these developments&mdash;wise
or otherwise, produce a well-made and readable
book&mdash;in short a good book? "In the printing of books
meant to be read," says an authority, "there is little room for
'bright' typography. Even dullness and monotony in the
type-setting are far less vicious to a reader than typographical
eccentricity or pleasantry. Cunning of this sort is desirable,
even essential in the typography of propaganda, whether for
commerce, politics, or religion because in such printing only
the freshest survives inattention. But the typography of books,
apart from the category of narrowly limited editions, requires
an obedience to convention which is almost absolute&mdash;and
with reason."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>It is the fashion, just now, to decry typographic conventions.
Some conventions and traditions deserve to be decried
and some have already been laughed out of existence. There
are, however, good and bad conventions and traditions in
printing, just as there are true and false developments, and
the trick is to know which is which! Convention and particularly
tradition are, generally, the crystallized result of
past experiments, which experience has taught us are valuable.
In some of the extreme modernistic typography a little
more tradition might come in handy. The trouble with the
modernist is that he seems afraid not to throw everything
overboard and mistakes eccentricity for emancipation. Thus
some books of today seem to be the arrangement of a perverse
and self-conscious eccentricity. Such printing is often
the work of eager, ambitious, and inexperienced men, and
because they are young and God is good, one can afford to be
patient; sure that they will, in the long run, outgrow the
teething, mumps, and measles of typography. Their convalescence
will possibly be hastened by meditating on the
saying of Lord Falkland that "when it is not necessary to
change, it is necessary not to change."</p>

<p>No movement ever accomplishes all that its first promoters
intended or hoped for; almost all movements make some lasting
contributions to our common stock. Every new idea,
every new invention brings along with its expected benefits
unforeseen evils. Modernistic architecture is at present exciting
because new and unusual; when more common it
will become commonplace. When it becomes difficult to
differentiate the exterior of a modernistic church from a
warehouse, we may get very, very tired of it. Then a compensating
reaction will set in and balance will be restored.
The same thing is true of modernistic typography. At present,
it shocks us into attention, but we get tired of being shocked,
for we do not want printing to surprise but to soothe us.
The modernist must remember, too, that "such a thing as an
underivative work of art does not and cannot exist, and no
great master in the arts has thought or asserted otherwise."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[Pg 311]</span>
We gladly admit that some modernistic formulas have had
good results. In architecture, perhaps to some degree in
typography, they have taught us to get rid of clutter and
useless ornamentation. But neither the one nor the other
leads anywhere&mdash;except to a dead end.</p>

<p>The conservative, however, need not think that all truth
is on his side. However much he tries to practise retrospective
or "period" typography, consciously or unconsciously his
work will show the influence of his time. Just as there is a
popular idiom in speech which varies in each decade, so there
is a current idiom in printing. All these idioms, literary and
typographic, have not come to stay, but some become accepted
terms. Under Theodore Roosevelt we suffered from
the word "strenuous." President Harding inflicted the word
"normalcy" on American speech. We now have "reactions,"
and "contacts." Clergymen "challenge" things, have "spiritual
adventures," talk of "strategic positions" for their
parish houses and aid parochial charities by "clarion calls,"
though if confronted with a "clarion" (if this instrument
exists outside of sermons) they would be quite unable to
blow it. All these catch-words and stock phrases are in the
air. We suffer much the same thing in typography, about
which there is also a new jargon which replaces the old
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clichés</i> of my youth about rhythm, balance, and colour. Neither
in speech nor printing can one make a clean sweep of the past
nor help being of the present, no matter how hard one tries.
I deplore violent attempts to make current printing accord with
the spirit of the age. It always has, always will, and does now.</p>

<p>Nor need the conservative sniff at typographic experimentation.
To turn to another department of daily life, what
would happen if no one had ever tried experiments with food?
In the distant past there was the first human being who&mdash;as
an experiment&mdash;ate an oyster, though perhaps first trying
jelly-fish with less comfortable results. Others died of eating
toadstools before people learned that they could survive on
mushrooms. Almost all our vegetable food we owe to gastronomic
adventurers. Thus the hide-bound conservative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[Pg 312]</span>
owes sustenance to the fruits, and vegetables, of experiment.</p>

<p>To speak more seriously, both modernist and conservative
should lay to heart what Benedetto Croce says in his <cite>Autobiography</cite>
about "the impossibility of resting on the results of
past thought" and the necessity of modesty in stating one's
present position. "I see," he writes, "a new crop of problems
springing up in a field from which I have but now reaped a
harvest of solutions; I find myself calling in question the
conclusions to which I have previously come; and these
facts ... force me to recognize that truth will not let itself
be tied fast.... They teach me modesty towards my present
thoughts, which tomorrow will appear deficient and in need
of correction, and indulgence towards myself of yesterday or
the past, whose thoughts, however inadequate in the eyes of
my present self, yet contained some real element of truth;
and this modesty and indulgence pass into a sense of piety
towards thinkers of the past, whom now I am careful not to
blame, as once I blamed them, for their inability to do what
no man, however great, can do ... to fix into eternity the
fleeting moment."</p>

<p>There is, to the reasonable mind, no real quarrel between
modernism and traditionalism in printing, <em>except in degree</em>.
Modernism must and does influence the conservative in spite
of himself&mdash;if by modernism we mean a healthy awareness of
the needs of the time in which we are living. Tradition must
and does influence the modernist, if by tradition we mean
patient and respectful appraisal of what that accumulation of
yesterdays, which we call the past, has to teach. It is only by
experience that we can effect a wise blend of the two. Then
we produce books which, while representing the best practice
of our time, will outlast it. The appraisal of their ultimate
values we must leave to the future.</p>

<p>"There is no past that we need long to return to," said
Goethe, "there is only the eternally new which is formed out
of enlarged elements of the past; and our real endeavor must
always be towards new and better creation."</p>

<em><small>The Amateur Printer</small></em>:<br />
<small>HIS PLEASURES AND HIS DUTIES</small></h2>

<p class="p22 center small1">From <cite>Graphic Forms: The Arts As Related to the Book</cite>. Copyright 1949 by
Harvard University Press. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</p>

<p>Although the title of this piece is sufficiently long to be
impressive and important-sounding, all I really want to write
about is printing as fun. I am going to write about the amateur
printer, and the amateur is the fellow who has fun.</p>

<p>I do not wish to belittle the affection a professional printer may
have for his work. He should love his work. But he can love it
only in a different way: for after all he is essentially a businessman
about it. His work, like that of any other businessman, is
something he has to sit down to by nine in the morning and something
he can't leave until five at night. It is something that involves
landlords and labor unions, payrolls and tax inspectors,
truckmen, office-boys, salesmen, compositors, pressman, bindery
workers&mdash;and customers. He has to worry about payments, and
depreciation, and publicity, and time sheets.</p>

<p>The professional has to concern himself with all these things
which are not printing at all, because he is in business and has to
make money. His primary yardstick of success as a professional
is: <em>How much money did we make last year?</em> Of course he has
other minor yardsticks of success too: he may be successful because
his presses turn out useful things like timetables, or gratifying
things like corporation reports for the year, or beautiful
things like four-color reproductions of Varga girls. To make
these things well is a kind of fun; and insofar as the fun comes
from the satisfaction in the thing itself rather than in the profit
that derives from it, I'd like to call it amateur satisfaction.</p>

<p>But essentially our professional printer&mdash;and permit me to limit
myself to the professional book printer&mdash;is supposed to make
money, not to have fun. And he makes money best, nowadays,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[Pg 314]</span>if his plant is equipped with the efficient modern machinery
which is designed for maximum production. Such machinery is
a wonderful creation of man; it is thrilling to watch in action;
and it gets results. But it has its disadvantages. Now that mechanization
is becoming more and more complete in more and more
places, we can begin to see clearly the greatest disadvantage of
all: under such mechanization individual workers have lost pride
and satisfaction in their work, because they have become mere
replaceable units of less and less importance; whereas the machines
they operate are more and more important, and have become
the essential units.</p>

<p>A generation ago the professional printer might have boasted
of his skilled compositors, who could set type more expertly, or
his skilled pressmen, who could make more careful overlays or
match ink better than someone else's craftsmen. Today he boasts
of his remote-control composing machines, his presses which
come close to eliminating make-ready altogether, and his ink supplier's
new gadget which matches colors scientifically. Today the
most successful printer is the one who with the least possible
dependence on man-power, can keep the most presses running
fastest for the greatest number of hours per day and days per year.
He is not the one with the most skilled craftsmen.</p>

<p>In such a world, where the executive's function is to feed the
machine and the workman's is to tend it, the human spirit begins
to cry out for the fun in work which I have called the amateur
satisfaction. It is true that today's shorter working hours&mdash;which
the machine makes possible&mdash;permit people to have more outside
fun; permit the manager to play more golf, and the workman to
play more softball (or more pinball) in the late afternoon; it is
true that more people now see more beer advertised on more television
programs, and may even drink more of it, in the evenings.
But managers and workmen alike turn so avidly to such kinds of
fun because they no longer get fun out of their daily work. It is
becoming harder and harder for people to equate work and happiness.</p>

<p>Now I do not set myself up as a social reformer dedicated to
the dream that all people should be happy in their work. Nor do
I propose as a step to this end that we revert, smash the wonderful
machines, and go back to the good old days when everyone
really <em>did</em> work with his hands&mdash;usually from dawn to dark, six<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[Pg 315]</span>
days a week. There was no pinball or television then, but <em>still</em>
I do not wish to go back! Nor do I suggest that the solution is
the promised thirty-hour week, with all the workmen driving
their own Buicks home at two each afternoon, and taking out
the wife and kiddies to Braves Field or the Gardner Museum.</p>

<p>But I do suggest that some of you people who really love printing,
but are too involved with the nine-to-five daily business of it
to enjoy it much, should enrich your lives by becoming amateur
printers in your spare time. You will have fun.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I yield to no man in my boredom with vegetables and salads.
I see green at every meal save breakfast. I have eaten enough
stringbeans to stretch&mdash;if they were straightened out and laid end
to end&mdash;from Fordhook Nurseries in Delaware to the city of Burbank,
California. If you could see all the lettuce leaves I have consumed
in my lifetime, piled leaf on leaf and dripping in their oils,
their vinegar, their mayonnaise, and their roquefort dressings,
you would be absolutely appalled. But, bored as I am with green
things on the table&mdash;bored because despite their goodness they
have been too plentiful and too easily come by&mdash;I am not bored
on those occasions when, like Candide, I cultivate my garden, get
my hands into the dirt, and smell God's good fragrance in the
loam. To watch the power of living things like salad greens and
stringbeans pushing their way out of the seed, up through the
earth, reaching down for water and up for sunlight with an irresistible
drive, is to realize afresh the power of life on this planet.
It is a reinvigorating and religious experience. It is impossible to
watch seeds grow into plants and flowers and fruit and still to
believe cynically in a mere mechanistic explanation for such a life
drive. To get back to the seed, the earth, and the root is to re-experience
the fun and meaning of life.</p>

<p>In the same way that I have become bored with salad, we have
all become bored with words, printed words. We have seen too
many of them, we have read too many of them, we have measured,
or proofread, or edited, or sold, too many of them. We have
forgotten their primal power, their irresistible living urge. We
have forgotten that sincere authors have not put them down on
paper because of two cents a word or 10 per cent of the retail
gross&mdash;that they have been written (in the best cases) out of
human necessity, human ebullience, human passion, human sym<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[Pg 316]</span>pathy,
or human understanding. The industrial book-printing
world cannot ever think of words in that way. It must always
think of them as areas of type 22 by 28 picas, as numbers of
pages which do or do not make up a multiple of thirty-two, as
units of sale at $3.00 less 40 per cent.</p>

<p>To go back to nature and become an amateur printer in such
an industrialized book world is like working in the garden when
you are bored with salad. You really get back to the roots of
words. If you are a genuine amateur printer, and set the type and
print the pages yourself, you actually can share in the creative
agonies and satisfactions of the author. For you put down his
words, letter for letter in your type-stick, just as he did with his
quill or his battered Remington. The best way on earth to appreciate
an author and his creative spirit (or for that matter to realize
more quickly the faults in him) is to pick him up letter by
letter from a California case. An even more acid test is to distribute
the type after printing him. In such a case you pick up half a
dozen lines of type at once and work backwards, distributing the
last word of the last line first. It is a revelation how the hollowness
of an author can show up under this treatment. It is especially
cruel to poets, for every word which is not really necessary,
which is there just for padding or for a rhythm or a rhyme, becomes
as noticeable as the well-known sore thumb. But the genuine,
sincere author with a pure style stands up beautifully under
such treatment, and has his reward in your pleasure at this discovery.</p>

<p>After you have set your author's type you must make up his
pages, choose his decorations or illustrations, and set his headings.
You must decide whether to stretch him to twenty-four pages or
condense him to sixteen. You must buy his paper, lock up his
pages in your chase, make him ready, curse your press which is
printing him, apply your ink to his words, and impress him for
posterity. Perhaps you will thereafter fold him, sew him, and encase
him in boards.</p>

<p>In so doing, you become, to the extent of sixteen or twenty-four
pages, in an edition of one hundred or three hundred copies,
God. You have created something which did not exist before, and
which would not have existed save for your thinking brain and
tired back and dirty hands. True, you have not created Heaven
and Earth, and you have undoubtedly worked at your creation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[Pg 317]</span>
for more than the original quota of six days. But anyway you
have given the world something which was at first only words
you loved, and is now a whole, real book, which you love all the
more because it is your book, your child, your embodiment of
those words. That is the fun and satisfaction of being an amateur.
In our printing world there is no other satisfaction equal to it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Good old Ralph Waldo Emerson was mortally right when he
wrote down his doctrine of Compensation. His doctrine of Compensation
says that every pleasure carries some penalty, every
gain some kind of loss. Every duty accepted gives you a satisfaction,
and every satisfaction received involves you in a duty.
Thus far I have written of the satisfaction of your being an
amateur printer. Now I wish to write of your duty and obligation.</p>

<p>The amateur book printer has a duty which, if he will accept
it, will in the long run return to him the greatest satisfaction. This
duty is to teach the professional, by example, about the outer
cultural world, and to experiment for him in matters of printing
style. Now this is directly contrary to what ninety out of one
hundred current amateurs would seem to think, and I must therefore
beg their ninety pardons if I disturb their habits of mind.</p>

<p>Most amateurs either don't trouble their minds about problems
of printing style at all, or else they fall too easily into the habit
of working in the Colonial style, or Venetian style, or some other
historical style, rather than in a contemporary one. Maybe they
do so for psychological reasons. And maybe not. I am too set in
my diction to learn the trick of talking in psychological terms.
I would express their case like this: Amateurs who work in historical
styles do so because they are romantics, romantics who turn
away from the impersonal machine world of the present for a
breath of the more human and glamorous-seeming past. I sympathize
with such an instinct, and hold myself ready to defend any
man who seeks to re-inject a human element into the printing
craft.</p>

<p>The trouble is, such amateurs think that because printing in the
past was done by hand, and because there is something more satisfying
and human about printing by hand, they must therefore
work in an antique printing style and make Colonial and Venetian
books in order to enjoy themselves. This is a false syllogism. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[Pg 318]</span>
strongly recommend printing by hand to amateurs because it will
give them greater satisfaction, not because it will make their
books look like antiques. It is too easy to fabricate such antiques,
and to do so will in the long run give you less enjoyment than
making something which in style is original and new.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact it is already too late to think in terms of
revivals and reproductions. In printing, the revival habit started
over a hundred years ago with Whittingham and Pickering, when
they dusted off the forgotten Caslon types and the eighteenth-century
style. It has been going on ever since, and reached a climax
of understanding and skill in our century at the hands of
Updike, Rogers, Rollins, Goudy, and others. This revivalism was
a kind of search for humanism, and a kind of rebellion against
commercialism. These men were not unique. In every generation
since 1800, in every art and craft, every field of thought, the Industrial
Revolution has prompted men to make the same search
backward for satisfactions which the modern world did not seem
to offer.</p>

<p>Too many of our amateurs are still making the same search,
although the Industrial Revolution is well over one hundred years
old, all the necessary backward searching has been done, and all
the historical styles have been reworked. Our predecessors have
made it unnecessary for us to go through the process once again.
We can see now that their work was an escape perhaps for them,
but that it can never be a durable way of creative realization for
us. From now on, we must join up with the forward-looking
crowd who think they can build a new world.</p>

<p>The book-printing industry has not been very forward-looking
in matters of style. With the exception of a few printers and
designers, book printers have been unhealthily backward. Therefore
the time is ripe for amateur book-experimentalists to prod
and teach them. The amateur can do it.</p>

<p>He is, or should be, a man with interests in other fields of culture
than his own. He is aware already of what has been done in
painting and music, in fabrics and furniture design, in architecture
too&mdash;most important of all. He must now help printing to
develop its own new styles, equivalent to those in other fields.
That he can do so is evidenced by the fact that in recent years
the greatest strides forward have been taken not by the profes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[Pg 319]</span>sionals
but by people who in a sense are amateurs, but who have
known how to apply modern ideas from other fields.</p>

<p>The Bauhaus group first became notable, between the wars, by
applying the functional theories of modern architecture to the
printed page. The Black Sun Press and Harrison of Paris applied
the ideas of Monroe Wheeler and others who were stimulated by
modern painting. There may be similar publishing projects in this
country today, but they are not yet influential. The most effective,
most vocal, most lovable of contemporary American influences
is that rugged individual Merle Armitage, whose ideas have
been influential in shaping my own attitude. Such people all know
that the world has changed; that it will never turn back again;
and that it is up to us to catch on to the flying coattails of Today.
I urge other amateurs to join the ranks of these apostles of change.
It will be a great day for all of us when ninety out of one hundred
are experimentalists, and not the other way around.</p>

<p>Of course in urging amateurs to develop new styles, I am not
recommending any easy hobby. It is simple, but dull, to copy an
old style. It is hard, but exciting, to work out a new one. And
while you are working at it, you must expect cynical observers
to give your experiments the adjective "wacky"; you must expect
certain curious kinds of people to praise your work for the
wrong reasons; and you must expect alternating moods of conceit
and frustration. The proofs you gloat over at night will
become commonplace by dawn. Your wife may go back to her
mother in rage and despair. You may need sleeping pills.</p>

<p>You will make misjudgments about the intelligence of ordinary
readers. You will make mistakes of taste. You will find it too easy
to get an effect by means of shock, and you will forget that any
book, even a twenty-first-century book, must be a coherent unit.
And you will often, since there are no highway markers for the
explorer, feel lonely and discouraged, and want to go back to the
old familiar well-traveled roads again.</p>

<p>But if you go through with it, or even if you just play with it
sometimes as a hobby, you can have great fun. For it will put you
out in the open, free to please yourself, with the boss and the
customer left far behind. You can be subtle or bold, as you feel
the urge, for you do not have to please the great common denominator,
the common man. You can advance your own work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[Pg 320]</span>
by looking to other fields of creation, enjoying and profiting by
the experiments going on in them. You can feel yourself a part of
the whole forward-looking culture of your day, and not someone
off in a little forgotten corner.</p>

<p>And, if you do strike a vein with the glitter of real gold in it,
you will become rich indeed. For you will have become a creator
in a new sense; your duty done as an amateur will be compensated
with a twenty-four-carat satisfaction. At such a moment of realization
you will have earned the privilege to rest and feel content.
As on a seventh day after six of creation, standing late at night
with bloodshot eyes and inky fingers and aching back in a paper-littered
room, you have become a creator. You have not merely
escaped from the flattened monotony of the machine age&mdash;you
have become one of the shapers of its future. More power to you
in that work!</p>

<em><small>Harsh Words</small></em></h2>

<p class="p22 center small1">An address delivered at a meeting of The American Institute of Graphic Arts,
in New York City, February 5th, 1940, on the occasion of the opening of the
eighteenth annual exhibition of the Fifty Books of the Year. Copyright 1940 by
T. M. Cleland. Reprinted by permission.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman and Members of The American Institute of Graphic
Arts:</p>

<p>The generosity of your invitation to me to speak on this important
occasion leaves me a trifle bewildered. I am so accustomed
to being told to keep my opinions to myself that being thus
unexpectedly encouraged to express them gives me some cause to
wonder if I have, or ever had, any opinions upon the graphic arts
worth expressing. But since it is the theory of your Committee that
I have, and it may never be anybody's theory again, and they have
gone so far as to give me no instructions or suggestions as to the
scope or the limitations of what I might say, it would seem as ungracious
to decline such an exceptional offer as it would be to
abuse it. So if I accept it as wholeheartedly as I believe it was
given&mdash;if I take you at your word and say things that I have long
wanted to hear somebody say&mdash;I hope it will not be thought an
abuse of this kindly tendered privilege.</p>

<p>I realize that, nominally at least, my subject must be that of
printing and typography as exemplified by the selection of the
fifty best books of the year which we are here to celebrate; and I
suppose, by comparison to deplore the fifty thousand worst books
which may be seen elsewhere. But by what may seem a very odd
paradox, I don't quite know how to stick to this subject without
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[Pg 322]</span>wandering a good way off it. Or, perhaps I should say that I cannot
approach it directly except by a very roundabout way.</p>

<p>If I have a thesis for these remarks, I can only develop it in
terms of a tree. This is because I do not believe that invention in
the arts can be picked from empty space like objects in a prestidigitator's
act. Fruits really grow on trees and trees have roots in
the earth. The tree I have in mind is cultural civilization: one of
its limbs is art and a branch of this we call the graphic arts, and a
twig on this branch is printing and typography. I promise not to
dig into the roots of this tree, but I may be found, monkey-wise,
climbing all over it before I am through.</p>

<p>I am at some disadvantage in that I do not belong to any organizations
for the advancement of typography and the graphic arts&mdash;not
even to this one&mdash;and I am ill-informed and out of touch
with what is going on in these fields except by casual observation.
But as members of this very useful organization, you are not engaged
in printing or other graphic arts, I take it, solely for each
other, but for the enjoyment and delectation of the world at large.
So there is a partially compensating advantage in my being "at
large" myself, and thus able to speak of present trends in the
graphic arts as they appear from the outside, looking in. But this
advantage may in turn be offset by the fact that I cannot honestly
speak of what I see with much enthusiasm. I can bring you no
message of hope or light of inspiration. Much as I am filled with
admiration and respect for many individual talents and accomplishments
that still contrive to exist, they seem to me to stand
unhappily isolated in what I can't help viewing as artistic bankruptcy
and cultural chaos. Among them are printers making
beautiful books and other things about as well as these things
have ever been made. But as to the general volume of printing,
no one has asked me, to be sure, what I thought was the lowest
point of artistic taste in the five hundred years of its existence
which we are celebrating this year, but if anyone <em>should</em> ask me,
I would be bound to say that we have reached that point just about
now. Things may get worse, but it's hard to see how they can. To
paraphrase a remark in the concluding chapter of Updike's classic
work on printing types, it has taken printers and publishers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[Pg 323]</span>
five hundred years to find out how wretchedly books and other
things can be made and still sell.</p>

<p>I am not forgetting that there were some very benighted periods
of taste in other centuries that would seem to refute this sweeping
assertion. Perhaps it is worth noting here&mdash;and the fact is
peculiarly ironical&mdash;that the design and style of official and
governmental things&mdash;money, postage stamps, bonds and stock
certificates&mdash;was created and solidified into a seemingly unalterable
convention at that hitherto all time low point of the
decorative arts in the mid-nineteenth century. So powerful is this
convention that we would be suspicious of a ten dollar bill that
was not visually saturated with ugliness. A counterfeiter with
aesthetic sensibilities must not only sweat blood but weep tears
over the job of imitating one. But in the sadly perverted taste
of that epoch there was a kind of innocence: standards were still
respected, and proficiency, though overworked and misdirected,
was recognized and not condemned.</p>

<p>Today when I look about in the bookstore, and more especially
on the newsstands, or open the pages of most of the magazines
with the biggest circulations, I want to do what the little boy
did in the story which was a favorite of my friend, the late Hal
Marchbanks. The little boy had been to his first party, and when
he arrived home, his mother said: "Did mama's little boy have
a nice time at the party?" "Yep," he replied. "What did mama's
little boy do at the party?" "I thow'd up."</p>

<p>Against this steady decline in both taste and workmanship,
your fifty books selection and exhibit each year has been a noble
effort, and in this country, almost the only concerted one of
consequence to uphold some standards. You have inspired both
publishers and printers to earnest endeavor to improve their
products with frequently admirable results. But these are only
fifty books out of how many other books and other printed things.
Without this good work of yours, one wonders if any standards
at all would survive the flood of cheap and easy mechanization,
careless workmanship and bad taste. Not that there is anything
wrong with machines. The first hand press, it should be remembered
by its sentimental admirers, was also a machine. We have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[Pg 324]</span>
not learned to use the machines at their best, but accepted them
like fruits in the Garden of Eden, and thought of nothing but how
much we could get out of them in speed and quantity and profit.
Because we can do with them easily what formerly demanded
time and pains to do at all, we have too easily assumed that they
delivered us from the need of any time or pains.</p>

<p>Before I go any farther on or off the track with these random
remarks, I should like it to be understood that I am addressing
them particularly to any students and beginners in the graphic
arts that may be present, rather than to those who are arrived.
I am a student and still a beginner myself, and so my interest
and my heart are naturally with my own kindred. I speak as an
old beginner to younger ones. I am at a great disadvantage with
regard to the number of years I have left in which to get started,
and if I have any advantage at all, it is only in experience with
the bewilderments and illusions that clutter our common way
in learning and trying to practice one or more of the graphic
arts. The confusions and distraction of this day make the path
of the student and beginner rough and tortuous. Having travelled
it for more years than I like to admit, when I look backward, I
am astonished to discover the number of twists and turns and
pitfalls I might just as well have spared myself.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most foolish of these was the fear of not being
original&mdash;what Romain Rolland calls "the fear of the already
said." The notion that I must do something new every day, or I
would not be creative&mdash;forgetting that God made the planets all
the same shape as far as we can see, and that the oak tree does not
alter the form of its leaves from year to year. There is no supposition
so pathetically misleading as that creative originality is
within your own volition&mdash;the notion that it can be acquired
leads to deplorable results. It distracts the mind and energies of
the young student from gaining needful technical competence&mdash;from
learning his trade, and in more mature stages tempts the
would-be artist into vulgar mannerisms and formulas which he
will call his "style."</p>

<p>The idea that originality is essential to the successful practice
of the graphic arts is more prevalent today than it ever was in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[Pg 325]</span>
days when the graphic arts were practiced at their best. The current
belief that everyone must now be an inventor is too often
interpreted to mean that no one need any longer be a workman.
Hand in hand with this premeditated individualism goes, more
often than not, a curious irritation with standards of any kind.
The conscious cultivator of his own individuality will go to extravagant
lengths to escape the pains imposed by a standard.</p>

<p>But of all the perils that lie in wait for adolescent artists there
is none more seductive than the bewildering array of ologies
and isms that leer and beckon to him at every crossroad of his
journey. Just as isms and ologies have taken the place, in social
and political life, of right and wrong; so have they become the
accepted terms of the arts. In fact, nonsense is now so universally
the language of art that it is nearly hopeless to try to make oneself
understood in any other.</p>

<p>Brood mare to all of these extravagancies&mdash;and I have lived to
see many of them come and go&mdash;is that one which achieves the
super absurdity of calling itself "modernism"; and none has
been expounded and exploited in more contradictory and antic
ways. To deliberately call oneself "modern" is no less ludicrous
than something an old Danish friend told me years ago about a
line in one of the books of a very prolific writer of historical
romances in his country. In a tale with a medieval setting this
writer had one of his knights in armour cry out to another: "We
men of the middle ages never take insults, etc."</p>

<p>Embraced with fanatic enthusiasm by many architects and
designers is the current quackery called "Functionalism." It, in
common with its many predecessors, offers a new gospel for the
regeneration of our aesthetic world by restricting all design to
the function of its object or its materials. Like the new religions
and philosophies that have paraded in and out of our social history
for countless generations, it purports to be an original concept.
It has brought to us such gladsome gifts as concrete boxes
with holes in them for buildings, chairs of bent pipe with no
hind legs, glass fireplaces, beds of cement blocks joined by structural
steel, the queer agglomeration of unsightly edifices we call
the World's Fair and many other specimens of stark and for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[Pg 326]</span>bidding
claptrap. Unless all signs are misleading me, it is another
mass vulgarity like the age of golden oak and mission furniture,
even now on its way to the junk pile or the attic, perhaps to be
someday rediscovered there and dragged out by future generations
in search of quaintness.</p>

<p>It seems to me, ladies and gentlemen, that <em>all</em> art was <em>modern</em>
when it was made, and still is if it is suitable to life as we now
live it; and I look in vain for any applied art worthy the name
that was not also, in some sense functional. From the buttresses of
a gothic cathedral to the gayest Chippendale chair one finds,
upon analysis, a perfect work of engineering perfectly adapted
to its purpose. If this were not so, these things would hardly have
endured for so long a time. So that common regard for function
which has always been the basic principle of first-rate design,
assumes the impressive aspect of a religion, with high priests
and ritual, by the simple addition of an "ism." As students and
beginners in search of truth, we are today being pushed and pulled
about by no end of such bogus preachments&mdash;familiar faces with
false whiskers&mdash;old and common principles dolled up with new
names and often used to account for incompetence and laziness.</p>

<p>And what is the meaning of this term "functionalism"? Must a
design be related to no functions except mechanical and material
ones? Might not the most fantastic and elaborate works of the
geniuses of the baroque and rococo styles have also been functional
in that they expressed the spirit and fitted perfectly the
life they were intended to serve?</p>

<p>We hear much holy talk of "simplicity" in this day and the idea
of simplicity expressed by a total absence of everything not
essential to mechanical function has been elevated to a fetich.
We have divorced simplicity from its old mate charm as we might
break up the happy relationship of ham and eggs or pork and
beans. But in this reverent renunciation of all adornment not
strictly functional in this limited sense, have we paused to ask
whether we are in fact following a basic human instinct, or merely
attempting to make a virtue out of poverty of invention? There
is no evidence that man is imbued with an instinctive love of
simplicity in the objects with which he finds it useful to surround<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[Pg 327]</span>
himself. Indeed, our museums are bulging with evidence to the
contrary. From the Cro-Magnon cave to gothic cathedrals, from
the temples of India to the palace of Versailles, the earth has been
made to flower with man's inherent love of ornament. It would
seem then that ornamentation is deeply rooted in the human instinct
since no tribe, however primitive in other respects, is without
it. The restraints of this instinct and the tempering of it with
what we call taste is a cultivated faculty like the restraint of our
other appetites; but to be a teetotaler in ornament or in anything
else, is to confess to either weakness of control or incapacity for
enjoyment. "A teetotaler," said Whitman, "is just another kind
of toper."</p>

<p>This instinctive yearning for ornamentation is well demonstrated
in the case of our own Rockefeller Center; where it has
been catered to with peculiar ineptitude. Here all the important
structures have been piously stripped of everything non-essential
to mechanical function. Pillars, pilasters, cornices and mouldings&mdash;ornaments
that at least have their genesis in structural
functions&mdash;have all been piously renounced. And then because
it was found that the human spirit could not tolerate such barren
starkness, and business might suffer from it, ornaments have
been pasted around its doorways and approaches like gold paper
lace on a pasteboard box&mdash;ornaments completely unrelated to
any structural function of any kind. Sculptures, fountains, trees,
flowers and awnings have all been pressed into service to compensate
for this spurious simplicity. Many of these things are
beautiful in their own right like Mr. Manship's golden figure of
Prometheus. One of the little office girls that further decorate
the scene at the noon hour, was overheard the other day explaining
to another that this was a statue of "Primiscuous escaping
from Responsibility."</p>

<p>So under this wildly flapping banner of "Modernism" marches
a quaint array of worn and shabby syntheses for art, each day
parading a new dress and a new alias. The common urge for self-expression
can always find one or another of them at its service.
For those who are particularly deficient in the talent, energy and
patience demanded for the mastery of an art, something called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[Pg 328]</span>
"non-objective" art has been invented. For this the only things
required are a box of paints, brushes and a surface to exercise
them on. With these simple and easily procurable tools you
express your own inner emotions and need not trouble yourself
with anyone else's or with what anyone else sees. If you watch the
others you will see that it is mostly being done with triangles, circles
or vortexes of paint just as it comes from the tube. If you have
no paint, toothpaste will do as well. If, after a few minutes of
this, you are tired, stop&mdash;you will have added spontaneity to its
other attractions. The fact that it deals only with your own emotions
will not prevent you putting it on exhibition for other people
to enjoy. If anyone balks at enjoying it, you smile wanly and
shrug your shoulders and pity them for their dumb enslavement to
outworn tradition. It works like a charm&mdash;no one will dare attack
you&mdash;they will all be afraid that you've got something there.
People have a terror of making mistakes&mdash;as if they had not
been made by the best people in all ages. It is the most perfect
device yet invented for attracting attention to yourself with the
least trouble. A generation ago we heard a great deal about "art
for art's sake": now it is art for the artist's sake, like bread for
the baker's sake or medicine for the doctor's sake. And I say,
for God's sake, tell me what art made through the vision of a
human eye with a brain behind it is <em>not</em> "non-objective"? No two
men will ever draw or paint the same picture of the same object.
Only the lens of a camera will render it quite objectively, and
even the camera in the hands of an artist is capable of some degree
of subjectivity.</p>

<p>And since I have inadvertently mentioned the camera, I ought
to say a good word for it too. It is just now in its hey-day and
people are taking greater pains with it than they are willing to
take with any other medium of artistic expression. I see a great
many very fine pictures made with it, in spite of its obvious limitations.
But it has also been tortured into serving as a medium for
self-conscious originality until its "new ideas" have come to be,
in their way, in their monotony and staleness, an intolerable bore.</p>

<p>The marvels of color photography have revealed to us hitherto
unsuspected depths of aesthetic sordidness. This factual repro<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[Pg 329]</span>duction
of what we are told are "Nature's colors," I am given to
understand, is not yet wholly perfected. Only when it is will we
know the worst&mdash;only then will we know what the things that
through our eyes have stirred us by their beauty, really are!
Perhaps another super instrument of disillusionment will be invented
to reveal us, not in form and color alone, but in spirit, to
each other as we really are. Good-by then to human love, respect
and friendship!</p>

<p>I have strayed a good way from my subject, as I warned you
that I might; and these remarks must appear by now to be
not only ramblings but the ravings of an old reactionary who is
blind to anything that is new. That deduction will be almost literally
correct, ladies and gentlemen. There is no denying that I
am old, and toward much that I see around me, I am reactionary;
and I have learned nothing in all my years of striving for knowledge,
more convincing than that statement in the Book of Ecclesiastes
to the effect that there is nothing new under the sun. I plead
guilty to this hideous indictment and throw myself on the mercy
of this court. I am even happy to have learned that much, and
wish, in the manner of the camp meeting revivalist, that I might
pass on something of this blessed revelation to the "brethern
and sistern" present.</p>

<p>While I thus brazenly deny the existence of anything really
new, and fail to recognize what is called "progress" and deplore
the waste of talent and energy that is dissipated in striving for
these things, I am far from blind to the value of revolt. Our creative
sense is all too prone to doze off into dreams of past glories.
From these, and the sterile copying of them, we may be awakened
and rescued by even the crudest of revolutions. We may benefit
from them provided we do not let them tear up our roots&mdash;provided
we still can recognize an illusion when we meet it. The
squirrel in his revolving cage must have some illusion of progress,
else he would not take any exercise, and without exercise he
would fatten and sicken and die.</p>

<p>And, remember, there is always progress to be made within
yourselves, no matter if it is the same progress in the same direction
that has been made by countless other souls. And there will,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[Pg 330]</span>
I hope, always be things new to you, as there are every day
things new to me, even if the sun has seen them all before. I don't
want to live a day longer than I can learn.</p>

<p>There is no reason to suppose that there is not today as much
latent talent for the arts in existence, as at any time in their history.
But talent for art is not talent for being an artist&mdash;one may
have much of the one, without much of the other. It seems to me
that there are more temptations and distractions working against
the talent to be an artist today than ever before. More alluring
short cuts and seductive philosophies&mdash;a disturbing babel of undigested
ideas and indigestible objectives. If in this riot you can
keep your heads and not lose sight of the important difference
between "a grain of truth" and the whole truth, if you can grow
in understanding of what it is you want to do, you may, even
now, have a good chance of doing it.</p>

<p>But what has all this to do with printing and typography and
their related graphic arts? I seem by now to be so far off the
track that it will take a derrick and wrecking crew to get me back
on again. As a matter of fact I have not forgotten the subject
altogether and have, in my lumbering way, been working toward
it. But because I can't think of typography as an art in itself,
unrelated to all the other arts, I could not approach it except by
the way I have.</p>

<p>All of these things that I have been complaining about in the
other arts, have their counterparts in present-day typography
and printing. The same restless craving for something "new,"
the same preoccupation with isms, the same monotonous sameness.
But this poison is aggravated in the case of printing and
typography, by the fact that of all the arts, it is, by its very nature
and purpose, the most conventional. If it is an art at all, it is an
art to serve another art. It is good only in so far as it serves well
and not on any account good for any other reason. It is not the
business of type and printing to show off, and when, as it now
so frequently does, it engages in exhibitionistic antics of its own,
it is just a bad servant.</p>

<p>For this reason the embarrassing ineptitude of the current
efforts toward a "new typography" are even more distressing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[Pg 331]</span>
than similar contortions in other fields. Typography, I repeat, is
a servant&mdash;the servant of thought and language to which it gives
visible existence. When there are new ways of thinking and a
new language, it will be time enough for a new typography. When
we have altered all of our manners and social customs, only then
will it be time to radically alter the well grounded conventions
of this very minor art. Within them there is now ample room, as
there always has been, for the exercise of ingenuity, skill and
individual taste. I suggest that those who cannot abide the conventions
of typography are mostly those who have never tried
them.</p>

<p>In what does the newness of this new typography consist? It
seems to be new as the neu in neurosis from which it largely derives.
It is new as it would be new for a man to enter the dining
room on his hands instead of his feet, and instead of eating his
soup, to pour it into his hostess's lap. It is as new and agreeable
and pleasing to look at as delirium tremens which it closely resembles.
The new typography engages in such side-splitting
pranks as putting the margins of a book page in just the opposite
arrangement to that which practical utility and well founded tradition
have always placed them. It might with equal reason and
originality, turn the type page upside down. In advertising display
it makes use of that highly original and refreshing device
of printing what is to be read at a cockeyed angle. The make-up
expert indulges that other fresh and original dodge of bleeding
pictures off the edge of the page so that a flat two dimensional
photograph is viewed without a frame on two of its sides and
must compete with a background of all the three dimensional
things in the room.</p>

<p>I refuse to bore you or myself by enumerating all the tiresome
stock-in-trade eccentricities of the typographic expert in
search of something new&mdash;the epileptic fits he throws to attract
attention to himself at the expense of the words he is printing.
You see enough of them every day to know what I mean. Nearly
every magazine and newspaper page, not to mention a good many
books, present the same revolting spectacle&mdash;the order of the day,
it seems, is disorder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[Pg 332]</span></p>

<p>And speaking of magazines, it has fallen to my lot from time
to time in the past thirty-five years to design and redesign a
number of periodicals of one kind and another. Such jobs require
really very little actual work&mdash;it's by endless argument and conference
that they can wear you to the bone. My simple purpose
with these things has always been to bring any measure of order
the case will permit out of the disorder in which I generally find
it. My mission, if I have any, is to suppress typography, not to
encourage it&mdash;to put it in its place and make it behave like a
decently trained servant. I find magazines rolling in the gutter
covered with the accumulated mud of years of dissipation. I
pick them up and brush them off, give them a cup of black coffee
and a new suit of clothes and start them off on respectable typographic
careers. But like other missionaries, more often than
not, I find them a year or so later, back in the same gutter, drunk
and disorderly and remorselessly happy about it.</p>

<p>If the philosophy of functionalism has hit the new typography
as it has the other applied arts, I see no evidence of it. On the
contrary, in this field, anything goes, so long as it is eccentric,
free from the restraints of reason, and can successfully discourage
the reader from reading. All the distortions of the Roman
alphabet that were discarded a half century ago&mdash;in fact any
types which are as nearly unreadable as types can be made&mdash;have
been dragged out again and called "modern." These range from
the elaborately ornamental letters of the most depraved periods
of design to the stark diagrams of letters that were called by
type-founders in my youth: "Printer's lining gothic"&mdash;as absurd
a misnomer as could be imagined, since they have nothing whatsoever
to do with gothic letters or any other letter forms known
to history. Laymen called them, more accurately, "block letters";
but in the new typography they are elegantly referred to as "sans
serifs" because, among other features of the Roman alphabet
which they lack, is a total absence of serifs. They bear the same
relation to Roman letters as would an engineer's drawings for a
trolley track. At the moment they are very much in vogue and are
widely believed to be modern and to be a simplification in harmony
with the new architecture, furniture and other things. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[Pg 333]</span>
are supposed to represent the spirit of our day like the noise of
rivetting hammers in a modern musical composition. They simplify
the traditional forms of type as you might simplify a man
by cutting his hands and feet off. You can no more dispense with
the essential features of the written or printed Roman alphabet,
ladies and gentlemen, than you can dispense with the accents and
intonations of human speech. This is simplification for simpletons,
and these are block letters for blockheads.</p>

<p>The users of typography and printing, the publishers and
advertisers, are also confused by illusions of their own. Foremost
among these is the notion that they require every week new
types to give freshness and effectiveness to what they print and
publish. This wholly unwarranted assumption is undoubtedly a
godsend to the type-founders, however disastrous it is to the
development of a sane and ordered typography. It has peopled
the earth with typographic experts who know "the latest thing"
and not much else, and it has relieved the designers of printing
from the burden of knowing anything about design. It is so much
easier to buy new types than to learn how to use effectively the
types we already have. And if, instead of flooding our composing
rooms with new types, which are seldom more than variations
upon old themes of distortion, our type-founders would give us
at least twice as many sizes as they now make, of a few good types,
we should have a really flexible medium to work in. We would
have to make fewer compromises with good design, and they
might profit commercially, as typography surely would profit
artistically.</p>

<p>And this constructive suggestion reminds me that I ought perhaps
to temper this hurricane of destructive criticism with some
further helpful hints. At the moment I can only think of two that
might relieve the dreadful situation that I have pictured. One
is that we organize a pogrom of all type designers&mdash;a little hard
on them perhaps, but they would gain martyrdom to a cause&mdash;and
the other is that we establish a concentration camp in which to
intern all those who think up or think they think up new ideas in
typography for such time as it will take them to recover from
their delusion. There they might while away pleasant hours in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[Pg 334]</span>
the distinguished company of the inventors of paper-towels,
pasteboard milk bottles and beer in cans.</p>

<p>With my younger colleagues still in mind, I ought to say something
of the practical problems that we encounter in professing
and practicing one or other of the graphic arts. We are, or should
be, if we are really artists, more concerned with what we give to
our art than with what we get out of it. But we have to live&mdash;or
think we do&mdash;and to do that by the practice of art is certainly no
easier now than it ever was. If anything, it's a little harder.
Beyond that inner satisfaction with what we can give&mdash;and there
is only a little of that and at rare intervals&mdash;the only two things
to be got <em>out</em> of art are money and fame; and I daresay there are
few of us who would not welcome a little of both. But we must
compete today with a great many of those who work for nothing
else; and who, under the banner of one or another of these isms
of which I've been prating, can concentrate upon that unique
objective unhampered by any serious interest in art itself. They
are devotees of success, like their commercial brethren, and by
means of the same promotional paraphernalia they succeed so
well that one is tempted at times to believe that the only living
art is the art of self promotion.</p>

<p>Another curious development of these times is the classification
of artists according to political ideology. We hear now of "left
wing" artists. As nearly as I can discover, these are to be recognized
by their contempt for any sort of craftsmanship and a
peculiar inability to keep their drawings clean. They make
penury&mdash;the unhappy lot of nearly all artists&mdash;a pious virtue,
and they are not infrequently big with pretension to being the
only serious interpreters of life and truth. These are balanced
on the other end of the political see-saw by a school of "economic
royalists" who have made of art a commercial opportunity. As
Industrial Designers with large staffs and control boards and
troops of indefatigable press agents, they have welded art and
commerce so successfully that it is nearly impossible to tell them
apart. Somewhere between the two is the artist; and he is as often
as not a forgotten man. Not quite poor enough to be picturesque
or heartrending, just well enough off to keep his collar and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[Pg 335]</span>
drawings clean, he must nevertheless spend an exorbitant part
of his life and energies in worrying about bills.</p>

<p>And now to stop the clamor of the butcher, the baker <em>et al.</em>,
to whom must we sell our graphic arts? For the most part, I
suppose, it will be to publishers, industrialists and advertising
agents. The publisher is a pretty decent sort, on the whole, but if
he is a book publisher, he can generally be recognized as such
by the fact of having very little money to spend on art. In my own
experience, the most generous and appreciative customer for our
wares has been the industrialist. What you do for him can often
increase his profit very materially, and he is not slow to recognize
that fact.</p>

<p>The advertising agent, speaking very generally and with the
particular exception of one very dear friend in mind, deals
largely in what might be called scientifically organized fraud. I
am aware that to say this now is to risk being called a "communist
transmission belt"&mdash;whatever that may be. It has even been
suggested that by these animadversions upon advertising, I am
biting the hand that fed me; but I suggest that I am biting the
hand that I have fed until I am fed up on feeding it. It may be
that you will find, as I sometimes have, in the ranks of these
shock troops of deception, sympathetic and amiable clients for
your work who can deal differently with artists than they deal
with the public&mdash;but not very often. Each of them employs what
is called an Art Director whose importance is derived, not so
much from art as from the financial size and number of advertising
accounts toward which he directs it. It is his duty to furnish
you with what he calls "ideas," upon the theory that an artist is
not mentally up to having any of his own. Ten to one he will end
by altering your drawing to give it the "wallop" thought to be
essential to all advertising. A public, already groggy and half
blind from the incessant battering of advertisements with a punch,
will hardly notice the difference.</p>

<p>"To think at all," says the Spanish philosopher, Ortega y Gasset,
"is to exaggerate." A careful measurement of anatomical detail
in the drawings and sculptures of Michelangelo will reveal
startling exaggerations of fact, but these enlargements upon fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[Pg 336]</span>
are but his medium for truthful expression. He gives us the figure
of a man or woman more essentially true than could be made by
any anatomist with micrometer calipers. So, I humbly pray,
ladies and gentlemen, that you will apply no instruments of precision
to my words&mdash;they are the best I could find in this emergency
for saying what I believe to be true. If you think me guilty
of exaggeration, the foregoing remarks are my only defense. But
if you accuse me of being facetious, I will tell you that I have
never been more serious in my life.</p>

<em><small>A Comparison of Calligraphy &amp; Lettering</small></em></h2>

<p class="p22 center small1">Copyright 1947 by the <cite>American Artist</cite>. Reprinted by permission of the publisher
and author.</p>

<p>Superior writing and able lettering have never made inconsequential
literature valuable, nor have poorly conceived,
incompetent calligraphy and lettering ever invalidated good literature.
Letters which are well considered, expertly executed, conscientiously
fitted to their purpose, however, can create visually
a spiritual state in a reader which will influence him to be receptive
to the message he reads. It may even be possible that beautiful
writing, aside from the intense pleasure it gives us as graphic art,
helps to make uninspired authors seem more profound.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is this realization that has made graphic artists in
recent years exhibit a notable increase in interest in American
"calligraphy." The quotes are intentional. So much which is not
calligraphy has had the term applied to it and so much which
is calligraphy has been considered something else, that some sort
of evaluation and comparative definition now appears to be wise.</p>

<p>The aura of romance which has surrounded the tools, the methods,
and the products of the scribe has tended, we believe, to
place them in the eyes of practicing letter artists somewhat higher
in the scale of the arts than those of the letterer. Hence the "lettering
man" likes to call himself a "calligrapher." This same snobbishness
is often evident between easel painters and illustrators,
between book illustrators and magazine illustrators, between book
designers and advertising typographers. And all of it is false. By
simple definition lettering and writing are related but certainly
not competitive arts.</p>

<p><em>Calligraphy</em> is "beautiful writing."</p>

<p><em>Lettering</em>, in modern usage, refers to built-up, designed forms.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[Pg 338]</span></p>
<p>Stanley Morison, in the <cite>Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite>, says: "Calligraphy
is the art of fine writing. Writing is a means of communication
by agreed signs; if these signs or symbols are painted
or engraved on stone or wood [or paper] we have that extension
and application of writing known as <em>lettering</em>, <em>i.e.</em> a script generally
formed with mechanical aids such as the rule, compass, and
square. But it is the essence of hand-writing that it be free from
such, though not from all, government.... Calligraphy may be
defined as freehand in which freedom is so nicely reconciled with
order that the understanding eye is pleased to contemplate it."</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i338" style="max-width: 31.25em;">

</div>

<p class="pc1 small1 center">The same nib was used for built-up and written forms in this freely
rendered fragment of a ninth-century manuscript.</p>

<p>Built-up and written forms each have their place. One of the
tenets of fine letter art is that the forms be in perfect taste; that is,
that the letter and its method of production be in harmony with
its use. A delicately drawn cursive is as out of place on a subway
card advertising a cough remedy as is a poster <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">egyptienne</i> on the
title page of a small volume of romantic poetry. To assume, however,
that either the written or the drawn form is the more aristocratic
is unsound. To attempt a representation of either by the
other is likewise illogical. Written letters, based on traditional
manuscript usage, are more serious in concept than their less
restrained contemporary built-up characters and do not permit
of the same unconcern with anatomical discrimination. Both,
properly executed, can be superb examples of letter art&mdash;and both
can be terrible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[Pg 339]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp76" id="i339-1" style="max-width: 15.625em;">

</div>

<p class="pc1 small1 center">A similar letter designed and built up using a brush.<br />
 Characteristic outlines to be filled in for above.</p>

<p>The growing practice of calling all script-like letters "calligraphy"
is unjust to writing and lettering alike. Particularly the
practice of producing with a pointed pen or brush the built-up,
tricked-out impersonations of broad nib writing must be abandoned
if the art of making letters is to remain honorable.</p>

<p>Having defined, then, the general limitation of the terms, let
us look at some of the principal differences in character between
the two. Historically, we find them side by side. Since they were
both produced by scribes and illuminators working in like tradition,
there was no question of fitness one with the other. Both
stemmed from the same source and were produced with the same
type of tool. They were necessarily in harmony.</p>

<p>Contemporarily, however, much lettering is executed by
craftsmen who neither know or care about the historical background
of the alphabet. The responsibility for this lies, we believe,
as much with the purchaser as with the producer of letters. The
art director, working in a viciously competitive field, demands of
the letterer something "different." The result is usually a built-up
form which has little in common with its ancestors, either in shape
or method of production. But, if it is handsome in itself, it may
have a real affinity for a text of type. A written element may
also serve beautifully as a foil for the rigidity of a type page.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[Pg 340]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter illowp61" id="i340" style="max-width: 30.6875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_340.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p class="pc1 small1">These two treatments of a title are by no means the only likely ones by either
method. The lower form was actually used. The letter was designed in the
spirit of the type which was used in conjunction with it. Perhaps if a written
title had been chosen, one based on an Italian rather than an English hand
would have been more suitable. The great difference in these two treatments
is that the written serves as a contrast, while the built-up harmonizes with the
type on the page.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[Pg 341]</span></p>
</div>

<p>To establish further the variance between calligraphy and lettering,
a brief inspection of the methods of production may be
advantageous. The designed form is conceived as a drawing&mdash;it
is a device which may be finished up with any instrument at hand.
The only limitation which the designer must not exceed is the
recognizability of the particular letter.</p>

<p>The written form depends upon tradition for letter shape and
upon tool for letter character. Distortion is possible and poor
form not unusual, but since the pen is essentially <em>the</em> letter-making
tool, the natural action of a properly cut pen eliminates at least
some of the opportunities for improbable forms.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp100" id="i341" style="max-width: 9.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_341.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<div class="caption"><p class="p1 small1">These two letters, enlarged from the two renderings of "Wartime
Correspondence," illustrate the control which is exerted by the cut
and size and handling of a square nib upon the calligraphic form as
opposed to the freedom from constraint in the built-up treatment. The
tool decided the shape of the first. A careful patterning of curves and
weights to conform to the type of the book page (Poliphilus) determined
the second. A Soennecken steel pen was used for the written, and a
pointed brush for the built-up.</p>
</div>

<p>The calligraphic and the built-up approach to the execution
of a book title may indicate how each may be employed frankly
and honestly without recourse to camouflage to procure particular
effects. The size, general weight, and disposition of the letters
are indicated in the rough layout. The artist who executes the
built-up rendering will keep the weight of letters <em>even</em> by constant
checking of one against the other. The calligrapher will
cut a reed or pen to this weight and thus maintain even color.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the designed form is completely and finally
established in the penciled form. The laying-out for the written
form is less accurate and is the product of a double pointed tool,
set to the width of the nib to be used. In any but a very tight design
such as this, the pen-executed letter requires rather less preliminary
penciling than is here indicated. A line for the bottom
of the letters is usually sufficient.</p>

<p>It has been impossible to crowd all one should like to write on
this subject into these few words. If, however, this first voicing
of a need for a sane concept of the relations between lettering and
calligraphy has even the smallest influence, the author will bear
with pleasure the rightful criticism of incompleteness.</p>

<cite><small>Typography for the Twentieth-Century Reader</small></cite></h2>

<p class="p22 center small1">The introduction from <cite>Printing of Today</cite>, an illustrated survey of post-war
typography in Europe and the United States, by Oliver Simon and Julius
Rodenberg. Copyright 1928 by Peter Davies, Ltd., London, and Harper and
Brothers. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.</p>

<p>In our enthusiasm for the spirit we are often unjust to the
letter. Inward and outward, substance and form are not easily
separated. In many circumstances of life and for the vast majority
of human beings they constitute an indissoluble unity. Substance
conditions form; but form no less fatally conditions substance.
Indeed, the outward may actually create the inward, as when the
practice of religious rites creates religious faith, or the commemoration
of the dead revives, or even calls into existence, the
emotions to which the ceremonial gives symbolical expression.</p>

<p>There are other cases, however, in which spirit seems not to
be so closely dependent on letter, in which the quality of the
form does not directly affect the quality of the substance. The
sonnets of Shakespeare remain the sonnets of Shakespeare even in
the most abominable edition. Nor can the finest printing improve
their quality. The poetical substance exists independently of the
visible form in which it is presented to the world. But though, in
this case, the letter is powerless to make or mar the spirit which
it symbolizes, it is not for that reason to be despised as mere letter,
mere form, mere negligible outside. Every outside has a corresponding
inwardness. The inwardness of letters does not happen
to be literature; but that is not to say that they have no inwardness
at all. Good printing cannot make a bad book good, nor bad
printing ruin a good book. But good printing can create a valuable
spiritual state in the reader, bad printing a certain spiritual discomfort.
The inwardness of letters is the inwardness of any piece
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[Pg 345]</span>of visual art regarded simply as a thing of beauty. A volume of
the Penny Classics may give us the sonnets of Shakespeare in their
entirety; and for that we may be duly grateful. But it cannot at
the same time give us a work of visual art. In a finely printed edition
we have Shakespeare's sonnets <em>plus</em> the lovely equivalent of,
say a Persian rug or a piece of Chinese porcelain. The pleasure we
should derive from bowl or carpet is added to that which the
poetry gives us. At the same time our minds are sensitized by
the contemplation of the simple visual beauty of the letters:
they are made more susceptible of receiving the other and more
complex beauties, all the intellectual and spiritual content, of the
verse. For our sensations, our feelings and ideas do not exist independently
of one another, but form, as it were, the constituent
notes of what is either a discord or a harmony. The state of mind
produced by the sight of beautiful letters is in harmony with that
created by the reading of good literature. Their beauty can
even compensate us, in some degree, for what we suffer from bad
literature. They can give us intense pleasure, as I discovered in
China, even when we do not understand what they signify. For
what astounding elegances and subtleties of form stare out in
gold or lampblack from the shop-fronts and the hanging scarlet
signs of a Chinese street! What does it matter if the literary spirit
expressed by these strange symbols is only "Fried Fish and Chips,"
or "A Five Guinea Suit for Thirty Shillings"? The letters have a
value of their own apart from what they signify, a private inwardness
of graphic beauty. The Chinese themselves, for whom
the Fish-and-Chips significance is no secret, are the most ardent
admirers of this graphic beauty. Fine writing is valued by them as
highly as fine painting. The writer is an artist as much respected
as the sculptor or the potter.</p>

<p>Writing is dead in Europe; and even when it flourished, it was
never such a finely subtle art as among the Chinese. Our alphabet
has only six and twenty letters, and when we write, the same
forms must constantly be repeated. The result is, inevitably, a
certain monotonousness in the aspect of the page&mdash;a monotonousness
enhanced by the fact that the forms themselves are, fundamentally,
extremely simple. In Chinese writing, on the other
hand, the ideographs are numbered by thousands and have none
of the rigid, geometrical simplicity that characterizes European
letters. The rich flowing brushwork is built up into elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[Pg 346]</span>
forms, each form the symbol of a word, distinct and different.
Chinese writing is almost the artistic image of thought itself, free,
various, unmonotonous. Even in the age of hand-writing, the
European could never hope to create, by means of his few and
simple signs, an art of calligraphy comparable to the Chinese.
Printing has rendered the Chinese beauty yet more unrealizable.
Where the Chinese freely painted we must be content with reproducing
geometrical patterns. Pattern making is a poorer, less
subtle art than painting. But it is still an art. By some one who
understands his business the printed page can be composed into
patterns almost as satisfyingly beautiful as those of the carpet
or the brocade.</p>

<p>The problem which confronts the contemporary printer may
be briefly stated as follows: to produce beautiful and modern
print-patterns by means of labour-saving machinery. There have
been numerous attempts in recent years to improve the quality of
printing. But of these attempts too many have been made in the
wrong spirit. Instead of trying to exploit modern machinery,
many artistic printers have rejected it altogether and reverted to
the primitive methods of an earlier age. Instead of trying to create
new forms of type and decoration, they have imitated the styles
of the past. This prejudice in favour of hand-work and ancient
decorative forms was the result of an inevitable reaction against
the soulless ugliness of nineteenth-century industrialism. Machines
were producing beastliness. It was only natural that sensitive
men should have wished to abandon the use of machines and
to return to the artistic conventions in vogue before the development
of machinery. It has become obvious that the machine is
here to stay. Whole armies of William Morrises and Tolstoys
could not now expel it. Even in primitive India it has proved itself
too strong for those who would, with Gandhi, resist its encroachments.
The sensible thing to do is not to revolt against the
inevitable, but to use and modify it, to make it serve your purposes.
Machines exist; let us then exploit them to create beauty&mdash;a
modern beauty, while we are about it. For we live in the twentieth
century; let us frankly admit it and not pretend that we live
in the fifteenth. The work of the backward-looking hand-printers
may be excellent in its way; but its way is not the contemporary
way. Their books are often beautiful, but with a borrowed beauty
expressive of nothing in the world in which we happen to live.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[Pg 347]</span>
They are also, as it happens, so expensive, that only the very rich
can afford to buy them. The printer who makes a fetish of hand-work
and medieval craftsmanship, who refuses to tolerate the machine
or to make any effort to improve the quality of its output,
thereby condemns the ordinary reader to a perpetuity of ugly
printing. As an ordinary reader, who cannot afford to buy handmade
books, I object to the archaizing printer. It is only from the
man with the machine that I can hope for any amelioration of my
lot as a reader.</p>

<p>To his credit be it spoken, the man with the machine has done
his duty. He has set himself to improve the sordid typographical
surroundings in which the impecunious reader was so long condemned
to pass his life. He has shown that cheap books need not
necessarily be ugly, and that machinery directed by a judicious
mind can do as well as, or much better than, the hand of an uninspired
craftsman. There are publishers in business today whose
seven-and-sixpennies, regarded as typography, are worth a guinea
apiece. (What they are worth as literature is another question.)
There are a dozen Presses producing fine work at moderate prices.
The men behind the machines have used their brains.</p>

<p>Some of our excellent machine-printers are still, it is true, too
fond of using decorations borrowed from the past, and types that
savour of another age than ours. So long as our sense of period
remains as strong as it is, so long as we retain our love of the
quaint and its more modern equivalent, the "amusing," this tendency
to substitute pastiche for original creation is bound to
persist. There is an incessant demand for the antique: we should
not be too hard on the printers who supply it. If they are sinning,
they are at least sinning in company. Let the architects and painters,
the interior decorators, and the theatrical producers throw
the first stone. There are pastichers among the printers, just as
there are pastichers among the professors of every art. But there
are also more original men, who are prepared to encourage modern
decorators and to use types that are elegant and striking without
being affectedly archaic.</p>

<p>With this last phrase I may seem to be damning the moderns
with the faintest of praise. But the truth is that Typography is an
art in which violent revolutions can scarcely, in the nature of
things, hope to be successful. A type of revolutionary novelty
may be extremely beautiful in itself; but, for the creatures of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[Pg 348]</span>
habit that we are, its very novelty tends to make it illegible, at
any rate to begin with. I know a rather eccentric German typographical
reformer, for whom legibility is the greatest enemy, the
infamous thing that must at all costs be crushed. We read, he
argues, too easily. Our eyes slide over the words, and the words,
in consequence, mean nothing to us. An illegible type makes us
take trouble. It compels us to dwell on each separate word:
we have time, while we are deciphering it, to suck out its whole
significance. Putting his theory into practice, this reformer had
designed a set of letters so strangely unlike those with which the
typographical practice of generations has made us familiar, that
I had to pore over a simple English sentence as though it were
Russian or Arabic. My friend was perhaps justified in thinking
that we read too much and too easily. But his remedy, it seems
to me, was the wrong one. It is the author's business to make reading
less facile, not the printer's. If the author concentrated more
matter into the same number of sentences, his readers would have
to read more carefully than they do at present. An illegible type
cannot permanently achieve the same result, for the simple reason
that it does not permanently remain illegible. If we are prepared
to make the effort to read until the novel forms have become familiar,
the illegible type will come to be perfectly legible. In practice,
however, we are reluctant to make this effort. We demand
that typographical beauty shall be combined with immediate
legibility. Now, in order that it may be immediately legible, a
type must be similar to the types with which we are familiar.
Hence, the practical printer, who has to live by selling his wares
to a large public, is debarred from making revolutionary innovations
in the designs of his type. He must content himself with
refining on the ordinary, accepted types of commerce. If he has
great typographical reforms in view, he must proceed towards
them by degrees, modifying the currently accepted designs gradually,
so as not to repel the ordinary lazy reader, who is frightened
by the idea of making any unnecessary effort. In other arts,
where form and substance are directly associated, revolution is
possible, may even be necessary. But the outward form of literature
is not typography. The association, in a book, of literature
with one of the graphic arts is in the nature of an accident. The
printer who would at one stroke revolutionize his art frightens
away readers, for whom the idea of revolution in literature, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[Pg 349]</span>
in any one of the graphic arts that is independent of literature,
has no terrors. The reason for this is obvious. People buy books
for the sake of the literature contained in them and not, primarily,
as specimens of graphic art. They demand of the typography
that it shall be beautiful, yes; but also that it shall give them immediate
and unhampered access to the literature with which it is
associated. Printers may desire to be revolutionary; but unless
they can afford to sell no books, they are compelled by the force
of circumstances to adopt a cautious policy of gradual reform.
The Communist must either turn Liberal or retire from business.</p>

<p>HOW DOES ONE DESIGN A BOOK? I CONCLUDE AS I BEGAN
WITH A FEW GENERAL IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS:</p>


<p>1. Allow the subject of a book to determine its design and format.</p>

<p>2. Design a book for effortless reading, utilizing the format to enhance
or interpret the text.</p>

<p>3. Use the prime materials&mdash;type, paper and space&mdash;to achieve your
results. Meaningless decorations disclose the designer's poverty of
invention.</p>

<p>4. Simplicity is the best policy.</p>

<p>5. Make no attempt to design every page ... let type and space have
their natural rhythm.</p>

<p>6. Understand the text ... know your primary aims ... let form follow
function.</p>

<p>7. Type ornaments have their place ... but an ornament designed for
general use has no particular significance.</p>

<p>8. A brilliantly designed book can't save a dull or mediocre text.</p>

<p>9. A page of type can be a thing of unique, arresting beauty.</p>

<p>10. Mere type legibility is to a book as mere shelter is to architecture.</p>

<p>11. Book design should be a synonym for the arrangement and integration
of materials&mdash;paper, binding, illustration, type and space.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[Pg 351]</span></p>

<p>My friends of the musical world believe that music is the most important
thing in life. Painters are absolutely certain that the reformation will
come only through an understanding of art. Acquaintances among the
engineers are sure that by technological development alone can emancipation
come to man, while scientists rightfully take the credit for
progress in the contemporary world. Friends in industry insist that mass
production is the great panacea. The photographers can prove that
photography makes the pictorial painters unnecessary, and the writers
I have encountered are convinced that the written word is the one route
to world unity.</p>

<p>However, the painter ... the musician ... the engineer ... the
photographer ... the industrialist ... the scientist ... and the writer
have a rendezvous with the book. Here, the knowledge, the romance,
the fiction, the facts, the speculations, the opinions, and the accomplishments
of the world are made permanently articulate.</p>

<p>This is our day, our time, our environment. We can make a statement,
through the employment of design, that is valid and true ... not divorced
from tradition, but using the great works of the past as a springboard
toward new horizons!</p>

PRINTER and PUBLISHER</h2>

<p>Josiah Franklin was reared a dyer in the village of
Ecton in Northamptonshire, but soon after his arrival in
America, about 1682, he foresaw a greater future in the
trade of tallow-chandler and soap-boiler. It was a calling
which seems humble enough in a day that has evolved such
mouth-filling occupational designations as sales engineer, merchandising
counsel, and mortician. Josiah Franklin, had the locution
been available in his era, might have asserted with all
accuracy that he was an important factor in public utilities&mdash;even
our own catch-phrase epoch has not been quite equal to the
coinage of the label "public utilitarian." For when the Boston
town watch wanted fresh candles they bought them from Josiah
Franklin&mdash;from other tallow-chandlers too, perhaps, but at least
some, by documentary evidence, from Josiah Franklin.</p>

<p>The close relationship between progress in the science of artificial
illumination and progress in the dissemination of the
printed word could be charted with almost mathematical accuracy....
Most of the books of colonial days were designed for
the use of those whose professions exacted some considerable
amount of "required reading"&mdash;ministers, physicians, lawyers,
public officials, schoolmen. The man who toiled with his hands
(and hands are eminently useful in the building-up of a new
country) labored while the light of heaven would let him and
then returned to a home wherein the conveniences were hardly
such as to make reading a pleasure. Lincoln studied by the glare
of blazing pine-knots, but the middle-class Bostonian and New
Yorker and Philadelphian of the generations immediately pre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[Pg 353]</span>ceding
Lincoln (to say nothing of their country cousins) had to
depend on illuminants that offered no greater inducements to
either the solace or the benefits of type.</p>

<p>Josiah Franklin's wife and their three children accompanied
him to America. Before her death she bore him three more children.
Josiah remarried, and of the second union ten children
were born. Of this multitudinous offspring thirteen grew to
maturity&mdash;a remarkable proportion for the time and region.
The eighth child and last son of the second marriage, christened
Benjamin after a paternal uncle, was at first intended for the
Church, but Josiah could not afford to give him the education
which this most learned of the professions demanded, and at the
age of ten, after receiving as thorough an intellectual rearing as
could be expected in so short a space, Benjamin Franklin quit
school to assist his father in the fabrication of candles and soap.
An elder brother, John, had already become proficient in the
twin arts of illumination and sanitation and had gone to the
bustling colony of Rhode Island to practice them. Another
brother (and another Josiah) had also investigated them, found
them not to his liking, and run away to sea.</p>

<p>Benjamin, also, made it clear that the parental pursuits were
not to taste, and a wise father, fearing another abrupt departure,
took Benjamin walking about Boston, that he might "see joiners,
bricklayers, turners, braziers, etc., at their work" and thereby,
boywise, make known to his elder which way his inclinations
lay. A patent leaning toward books at length persuaded the
father to make him a printer, despite the fact that another
brother, James, Benjamin's elder by nine years ... had adopted
the craft. Benjamin conceded a preference to the claims of printing
over those of tallow-chandlery, but he still sniffed, with the
true landsman's appetite, the tang of the salt breeze that blew in
from the east. Josiah, however, was insistent, and the parental
insistence of 1718 was no toy scepter to swing above the head of
a sub-adolescent boy. Accordingly, Benjamin was duly indentured
to James "to serve as an apprentice till I was twenty-one
years of age, only I was to be allowed journeyman's wages during
the last year."</p>

<p>Before long, Benjamin was writing odds and ends of verse,
and James, with the inbred Franklin sagacity, encouraged him
in his endeavors and let him put some of his compositions in
type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[Pg 354]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One (declared Benjamin) was called <cite>The Lighthouse Tragedy</cite>, and
contained an account of the drowning of Captain Worthilake, with
his two daughters: the other was a sailor's song, on the taking of
Teach (or Blackbeard) the pirate. They were wretched stuff, in the
Grub-street-ballad style; and when they were printed he sent me
about the town to sell them. The first sold wonderfully, the event
being recent, having made a great noise. This flattered my vanity;
but my father discouraged me by ridiculing my performances, and
telling me verse-makers were generally beggars.</p></div>

<p>The importance of these two pieces consists in the fact that
they were "the first with which Franklin's name can be identified
as either author or printer," according to Dr. William J.
Campbell, who adds that "no copy is known to exist, nor is the
exact title of either of them known." This was true in 1918,
when Dr. Campbell's admirable catalogue of <cite>The Collection
of Franklin Imprints in the Museum of the Curtis Publishing
Company</cite> was issued, and it is unfortunately still true today
[1935]. If they were at all like similar productions of both earlier
and later date, they were broadsides&mdash;single sheets that were
distributed like handbills, the main difference being that they
commanded a price. They would command a fantastic price
today, together or singly, and their eventual discovery is by no
means beyond the bounds of possibility. A copy of one&mdash;or copies
of both&mdash;may be tucked away in some forgotten contemporary
theological compendium which has not been opened for a century.</p>

<p>The disappearance of these broadsides is regrettable on many
counts, not least of which is the fact that even if Benjamin had
never accomplished anything else, he could at least claim credit
for sponsoring perhaps the most textually interesting productions
of his brother's press. James Franklin was a skilled printer&mdash;London
trained, and "no slovenly self-taught colonial," in
Paul Leicester Ford's phrase&mdash;and James was not, of course, in
any degree responsible for the dullness of the copy that was
brought to his shop. A brief glance at a few of his imprints of
this period is of interest mainly because of the certainty that
Benjamin worked on many of them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The product of James Franklin's press (says Ford in <cite>The Many-Sided
Franklin</cite>, New York, 1899) is a dreary lot of "gone-nothing-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[Pg 355]</span>ness."
A few of the New England sermons of the day; Stoddard's
<cite>Treatise on Conversion</cite>; Stone's <cite>Short Catechism</cite>; <cite>A Prefatory
Letter about Psalmody</cite>, in defense of church singing, which many
Puritans still held to be unholy; an allegory styled <cite>The Isle of Man,
or, Legal Proceedings in Manshire Against Sin</cite>; Care's <cite>English Liberties</cite>;
sundry pamphlets on the local politics of the moment, such as
<cite>A Letter from One in the Country to his Friend in Boston</cite>, <cite>News from
the Moon</cite>, <cite>A Friendly Check from a Kind Relation to the Chief Cannonneer</cite>,
and <cite>A Word of Comfort to a Melancholy Country</cite>; two or
three tractates on inoculation, and one aimed half at the Boston
clergy and half at the fair sex, entitled <cite>Hooped Petticoats Arraigned
by the Light of Nature and the Law of God</cite>, were the chief output of
the new printer during the years his brother served him.</p></div>

<p>In the summer of 1721, James Franklin established a newspaper,
<cite>The New England Courant</cite>. Two years earlier he had
been engaged to print the <cite>Boston Gazette</cite>, but with the transfer
of its management a few months later the contract had gone
elsewhere. The <cite>Courant</cite> was a new departure even for the novelty
that was American journalism&mdash;so extensive and violent a
departure, indeed, that in the following year the authorities
sentenced the printer-proprietor to a month's imprisonment for
his insolence. The punishment did not improve him; free again,
he pressed the thorn of the <cite>Courant</cite> deeper into the flesh of his
persecutors, with the consequence that he was soon forbidden
"to print or publish" either the <cite>Courant</cite> "or any other pamphlet
or paper of the like nature" unless it were first submitted to the
secretary of the province.</p>

<p>There were two apparent ways out of the dilemma, and one
was as eminently unsatisfactory as the other. The first was to
quit printing and publishing. The second was to submit to the
censorship. James hit upon a more ingenious solution. He
turned the <cite>Courant</cite> over to sixteen-year-old Benjamin. Benjamin's
indentures as apprentice to James had five years to run,
and in order to forestall any objection on the part of the authorities
that an apprentice was not competent to manage the paper,
the indentures were ostentatiously canceled and a new document
drawn up as a private and confidential (but none the less
binding) memorandum which in theory was no one's affair save
James's and Benjamin's. The half-sheet issue of the <cite>Courant</cite><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[Pg 356]</span>
for February 4-11, 1723, identified it as "printed and sold by
Benjamin Franklin in Queen Street, where Advertisements are
taken in." Benjamin Franklin's name thus first appeared in an
imprint. It remained on the tail-board of the <cite>Courant</cite> until the
paper's discontinuance in 1726, long after Benjamin had left
Boston.</p>

<p>The gratifying tableau of two stalwart brothers battling loyally
side by side for freedom of the press, however, was not the
whole picture. James and Benjamin had differences, and Benjamin
later admitted that he himself was "perhaps ... too saucy
and provoking," and that James, despite "the blows his passion
too often urged him to bestow upon me," was "otherwise not
an ill-natur'd man." Benjamin, at all events, decided to take advantage
of the freedom accorded him by the cancellation of his
indentures, which act he later conceded to have been "not fair"
and "one of the first errata of my life." James spread the tidings
of this perfidy throughout Boston, and every local printing
establishment thereupon became a closed shop to Benjamin
Franklin.</p>

<p>If James assumed that Benjamin would thus be forced to
return to his own shop, he reckoned without his Benjamin. For
not long thereafter, with the connivance of a friend, John Collins,
Benjamin was smuggled aboard a New York-bound sloop,
and three days later, thanks to a fair wind, he was in a city which
was not yet a metropolis judged even by easy colonial standards.
He called on "old Mr. William Bradford" (aged sixty), who had
nothing to offer, but who suggested that his son Andrew, then
flourishing (after a fashion) in Philadelphia, might have a position
for him, since Andrew's "principal hand," Aquila Rose,
had just died.</p>

<p>Franklin set out by water by way of Perth Amboy. It is interesting
to note, in view of the dispute regarding the earliest
New Jersey imprint ... that the trip from New York to the New
Jersey port took thirty hours. All in good time he reached
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Washington did not cut down a cherry tree and then inform
his father that he could not tell a lie; Wellington did not say
"Up, Guards, and at 'em!" or Pershing, "Lafayette, we are here."
The dear old legends explode all about us; it is gratifying to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[Pg 357]</span>
recall that there is one at least the accuracy of which is unimpeachable.
Walking up Market Street, Philadelphia, Benjamin
Franklin did pass the home of his wife-to-be with a roll under
each arm and munching a third, and his wife-to-be did see him
and note that he made "a most awkward, ridiculous appearance."</p>

<p>Andrew Bradford had nothing to offer&mdash;the vacancy left by
the death of Aquila Rose had already been filled. But Franklin
was not yet done with the ghostly trail of Aquila. At Andrew
Bradford's suggestion he waited on Samuel Keimer, who had
recently set up as a printer despite a meager endowment of
equipment, native ability, or acquired skill. He found Keimer
"composing an Elegy on Aquila Rose" directly from the type.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>So there being no copy (recorded Franklin), but one pair of
cases, and the Elegy likely to require all the letters, no one could
help him. I endeavor'd to put his press (which he had not yet us'd,
and of which he understood nothing) into order fit to be work'd with;
and, promising to come and print off his Elegy as soon as he should
have got it ready, I return'd to Bradford's, who gave me a little job
to do for the present, and there I lodged and dieted. A few days after,
Keimer sent for me to print off the Elegy. And now he had got another
pair of cases, and a pamphlet to reprint, on which he set me to work.</p></div>

<p>This broadside poem, therefore, was the first piece of Philadelphia
printing with which Franklin's name is clearly identified.
The "pamphlet to reprint" may have been <cite>A Letter to a
Friend in Ireland</cite>, <cite>The Doctrine of Absolute Reprobation Refuted</cite>,
<cite>A Letter from One in the Country to His Friend in the
City</cite>, <cite>A Parable</cite>, or (and this would certainly have been Franklin's
choice) <cite>The Curiosities of Common Water</cite>, all of which
Keimer imprints of 1723 are listed in the short-title check list
which follows the Curtis catalogue. No more specifically is it
possible to identify the "little job" which Andrew Bradford
gave him.</p>

<p>It is not likely that Franklin would have long continued with
Keimer (who was "an odd fish; ignorant of common life, fond
of rudely opposing receiv'd opinions, slovenly to extream dirtiness,
enthusiastic in some points of religion, and a little knavish
withal") even if a roundabout coincidence had not brought him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[Pg 358]</span>
to the attention o£ the governor of the province, Sir William
Keith, whose quarrel with William Bradford had been one of
the impulses that had established the latter as New York's first
printer. Keimer "star'd like a pig poison'd" one day when no
less a worthy than Sir William entered the shop in search of the
new assistant from Boston. Governor and assistant adjourned to
a tavern, where the former disclosed a grandiose idea for setting
the newcomer up in a shop of his own. He must first, of course,
go to London to buy equipment, and to this end the governor
loaded him down with enthusiasm and letters of credit. After a
short visit to Boston, where all "made me welcome, except my
brother," who "receiv'd me not very frankly, look'd me all over,
and turn'd to his work again", Franklin sailed for London,
which he reached the day before Christmas, 1724&mdash;to learn, to
his intense mortification, that Sir William's letters of credit
were worthless, since that gentleman's prowess as a promiser and
his shortcomings as a performer were rather more familiar in the
old country than in the new.</p>

<p>Franklin, however, had little difficulty in extricating himself
from the crisis into which he was precipitated on his arrival in
London by the non-negotiability of Sir William Keith's commercial
paper. "I immediately got into work at Palmer's," he
says, "then a famous printing house in Bartholomew Close, and
here I continu'd near a year." Samuel Palmer, declares John
Clyde Oswald in <cite>Benjamin Franklin, Printer</cite> (New York, 1917),
"was more than an ordinary printer. He had visited America,
was letter-founder as well as printer, and was engaged in the
writing of 'A History of Printing,' only a third of which he had
completed when he died in 1732."</p>

<p>Franklin identifies only one of the jobs on which he worked
at Palmer's. "I was employed," continues the <cite>Autobiography</cite>,
"in composing for the second edition of Wollaston's <cite>Religion
of Nature</cite>." The name of William Wollaston (1659-1724) now
survives mainly by virtue of this adventitious association with a
nineteen-year-old immigrant compositor. <cite>The Religion of Nature
Delineated</cite> first appeared in 1722 in a small privately
printed edition. Presumably this first edition is now rare, but
no collector is impressed thereby, preferring above it that on
which Franklin worked (the third in strict sequence, but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[Pg 359]</span>
second published edition), which, happily, is relatively common.
It bears the imprint: "London: Printed by S. Palmer, and sold
by B. Lintott, W. and J. Innys, J. Osborn, J. Batley, and T. Longman.
1725." The printer from America pondered over the copy
as he set it, and out of his ruminations came a pamphlet reply
to the recently deceased author: <cite>A Dissertation on Liberty And
Necessity, Pleasure and Pain</cite> (London, 1725). Franklin printed
one hundred copies, gave a few to friends, and then, repenting
of his materialistic agnosticism, "burnt the rest except one copy";
pride of authorship would not wholly down. That copy may be
one of the four known to survive today, all in institutional collections.</p>

<p>Receiving a better offer from John Watts, who conducted a
larger printing establishment, Franklin went thither, remaining
six months, when he accepted the proposal of a Philadelphia
merchant then in London that he return and act "as his clerk,
keep his books, in which he would instruct me, copy his letters,
and attend the store." In leaving London, therefore, Franklin
supposed that he thereby "took leave of printing forever."</p>

<p>Man proposes. Franklin and his new employer reached Philadelphia;
the store was duly opened and its new clerk installed;
four months later the employer died. The establishment was
taken over by the executors and Franklin was out of work.
Keimer wanted him back as foreman of his new and larger shop,
but Franklin, who knew well his Keimer, first sought a place at
his new trade of clerk and salesman. Nothing offered, so he reluctantly
accepted Keimer's bid. The affiliation did not last long.
Franklin and Keimer quarreled over "a trifle" that represented
the culmination of a long series of abuses:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A great noise happening near the courthouse, I put my head out
of the window to see what was the matter. Keimer, being in the
street, look'd up and saw me, call'd out to me in a loud voice and
angry tone to mind my business, adding some reproachful words,
that nettled me the more for their publicity, all the neighbors who
were looking out on the same occasion, being witness how I was
treated. He came up immediately into the printing-house, continu'd
the quarrel, high words pass'd on both sides, he gave me
the quarter's warning we had stipulated, expressing a wish that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[Pg 360]</span>
had not been oblig'd to so long a warning. I told him that his
wish was unnecessary, for I would leave him that instant; and so,
taking my hat, walk'd out of doors.</p></div>

<p>Had affairs not fallen out thus ludicrously, then some other
incident would have "snapt our connections." If no "great noise"
had occurred near the courthouse (what, one wonders, was the
cause of the disturbance?), there would still have been a subsequent
great noise in Keimer's shop, and the hireling would have
spoken his piece to the overlord and walked out of the identical
door to the fulfillment of his high destiny.</p>

<p>Franklin was of more than half a mind to return to Boston, in
which event Philadelphia would one day have been compelled
to seek another patron saint. Fortunately for Philadelphia,
while working at Keimer's, Franklin had struck up a friendship
with Hugh Meredith, a fellow craftsman, who suggested a partnership.
A secret agreement was drawn up, and pending the
completion of arrangements for launching the venture, Franklin
sought temporary work at Bradford's. Keimer meanwhile
was negotiating with the provincial government of New Jersey
for the printing of an issue of paper money at Burlington, and
urged Franklin to accompany him if he was awarded the job.
The plan went through, and the pair were in Burlington three
months. "There is not a single piece of this paper money known
to exist today," says Dr. Campbell, "and of the New Jersey Laws
that they printed at the same time there are only two known
copies...."</p>

<p>In the summer of 1728 the new firm of B. Franklin and H.
Meredith came into existence. They had scarce "opened our
letters" (their cases, that is, not the morning mail) when a friend
"brought a countryman to us, whom he had met in the street
inquiring for a printer." The identity of this bucolic, casual,
but superlatively important patron of the typographic arts is
unknown and probably forever unknowable, for he could hardly
have been aware that he was the instrument of Providence
chosen to motivate the first imprint issued by Franklin as a
master printer. Dr. Campbell surmised the job was "probably
stationery or a small handbill." Whatever it was, it has probably
vanished beyond hope of recall, or at least beyond hope of
positive identification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[Pg 361]</span></p>

<p>Almost on the heels of this first customer came another&mdash;none
other than Samuel Keimer, whose general ineffectualness and
chronic state of panic provide much of the comic relief in the
history of early American printing. Keimer had been working
off and on for three years on William Sewell's <cite>History of the
Rise, Increase, and Progress of the Christian People Called
Quakers: The Third Edition, Corrected</cite>. The end was not in
sight, and Keimer, evidently in a condition of acute mental
distress, rushed to the new shop for assistance. Franklin and
Meredith composed and printed "forty sheets," totaling nearly
a third of the seven hundred pages&mdash;the first known job to issue
from their shop, even though it did not bear their imprint.
Sewell's <cite>History</cite> is doubly a Franklin item, as Franklin must
have worked on the book while he was still in Keimer's employ.</p>

<p>Thanks to the diligence of its proprietors&mdash;or of one of them,
for Meredith "was often seen drunk in the streets, and playing
at low games in alehouses"&mdash;the new shop prospered. But about
the middle of 1730 it encountered a hazard which its sponsors
had not foreseen. Meredith's father had advanced one hundred
pounds to put the enterprise on its feet and had promised another
hundred. When the time came for him to meet his obligation,
he could not, and "the New Printing-Office near the Market"
was faced with a creditor's suit. This crisis confirmed young
Meredith's conviction that he was not cut out for the printing
business; moreover, he was anxious to join a company of fellow
Welshmen who were planning a settlement in North Carolina.
Two of Franklin's friends offered to come to the aid of the
senior partner, and the difficulty was amicably adjusted. Thus
was the "B. Franklin" imprint born. It appeared for the first
time not on anything in English, but at the bottom of the title-page
of <cite>Mystische und Sehr Geheyme Sprueche</cite>, by Conrad
Beissel, whose religio-communistic Ephrata colony, itself to become
one day an important printing center, had been organized
only a few years before.</p>

<p>Shortly before the dissolution of the firm of Franklin and
Meredith there had been another odd run-in with Keimer.
Franklin was already planning a newspaper, and "foolishly"
imparted the secret to a friend who forthwith made it known
to Keimer. Toward the end of 1728 the not-to-be-anticipated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[Pg 362]</span>
Keimer issued the first number of <cite>The Universal Instructor in
all Arts and Sciences: and Pennsylvania Gazette</cite>. It was Keimer's
inescapable genius to start what he could not finish, and he was
soon glad to dispose of the paper to Franklin and Meredith,
whose control dates from October 2, 1729. One of Franklin's
first acts as a newspaper publisher&mdash;his memory must have harked
back to the old Boston days&mdash;was to shorten the too comprehensive
title to <cite>The Pennsylvania Gazette</cite>.</p>

<p>Probably some three months after the departure of Meredith,
Franklin initiated a new partnership. He married. "Partnership"
is no romantic figure of speech. The name of Deborah Read has
an honored place on the roster of women who helped to make
American printing. By her husband's own testimony, her share
in the work of the establishment included, in some measure,
the "folding and stitching" of pamphlets, and it is not unlikely
that her hands had a busy share in the preparation of some of
the series of pamphlets with which, more than with any other,
Franklin's name is most clearly associated as author-printer-publisher&mdash;the
<cite>Poor Richard</cite> almanacs.</p>

<p>The importance of the almanac in the colonial scheme has
already been stressed. Franklin was naturally alert to this importance;
in fact, as soon as the house of Franklin and Meredith
was in existence he had commissioned Thomas Godfrey to compile
an almanac. Godfrey was "a self-taught mathematician,
great in his way," but "he knew little out of his way," and there
was considerable of the prima donna in his make-up. He prepared
almanacs for 1730, 1731, and 1732, and then, in an outburst
of temperament, transferred his skill to the shelter of
Andrew Bradford. The fortunate result, certainly not anticipated
by Thomas Godfrey in his dudgeon, was, as Paul Leicester
Ford defines it, the birth of American humor. Franklin initiated
the <cite>Poor Richard</cite> series, compiling the bulk of the contents himself,
but attributing their authorship to Richard Saunder or
Saunders, whose almanacs had enjoyed enormous popularity in
England and were still enjoying it, though Saunders had been
gone this many a year. A <cite>Poor Robin</cite> series of almanacs was also
popular in England, and James Franklin a few years earlier had
begun a series of Rhode Island almanacs under this title. <cite>Poor
Richard</cite> was an immediate success, and though the first number
was not advertised in <cite>The Pennsylvania Gazette</cite> until December<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[Pg 363]</span>
19, 1732, which was rather late in the year for a new almanac,
three printings were necessary to supply the demand. <cite>Poor
Richard</cite> thereafter issued regularly every December under
Franklin's own editorship until 1757 (for 1758).</p>

<p><cite>Poor Richard's</cite> rich wisdom has become part of common
speech wherever English or any other language is spoken. Everyone
from China to Peru knows that God helps those that help
themselves, that three removes are as bad as a fire, that</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"> <em>Vessels large may venture more,<br />
But little boats should keep near shore.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>A recent commentator&mdash;Carl L. Becker in the <cite>Dictionary of
American Biography</cite>&mdash;says of the <cite>Poor Richard</cite> almanacs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Nothing better exhibits the man, or better illustrates his ingenuity
as an advertiser.... "Richard Saunders," the Philomath
of the <cite>Almanack</cite>, was the Sir Roger de Coverley of the masses,
pilfering the world's store of aphorisms, and adapting them to the
circumstances and the understanding of the poor. "Necessity never
made a good bargain." "It is hard for an empty sack to stand upright."
"Many dishes make diseases." "The used key is always
bright." The <cite>Almanack</cite> was immediately successful and commonly
sold about ten thousand copies. "As Poor Richard says" became
a current phrase, used to give weight to any counsel of thrift. The
work made Franklin's name a household word throughout the
colonies.... The introduction to the last <cite>Almanack</cite> (Father
Abraham's speech at the auction) spread the fame of Poor Richard
in Europe. It was printed in broadsides and posted on walls in
England, and, in translation, distributed by the French clergy
among their parishioners. It has been translated into fifteen languages,
and reprinted at least four hundred times.</p></div>

<p>Franklin's rise to the position of the most important printer
in the colonies after the well-entrenched Bradfords was now
rapid. Before long he was official printer to Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, and Delaware. Of the bulk of his non-governmental productions,
Ford writes that while generally "of little moment,"
still "there can be no doubt that as a whole they contain more of
genuine merit than those of any other printer of the same or
previous periods in the colonies, the amount of doctrinal and
polemical theology being a minimum, and bearing a less pro<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[Pg 364]</span>portion
to the whole mass than can be found in the books of
contemporary American printers." In 1735 appeared over Franklin's
imprint James Logan's <cite>Cato's Moral Distichs Englished in
Couplets</cite>. Nine years later Franklin sponsored Samuel Richardson's
<cite>Pamela</cite>&mdash;not only the first American edition, but the first
novel to be printed in America, "Price 6 s." In the same year,
1744, he issued what is generally regarded as the typographical
masterpiece of his press, <cite>M. T. Cicero's Cato Major, or His Discourse
of Old-Age: With Explanatory Notes</cite> (also Englished by
James Logan), referring to it in a four-page foreword of his own
composition as "this first Translation of a Classic in this Western
World." This was a wide error, for George Sandys had translated
Ovid on the banks of the James River a life-span earlier, and
the translation had been printed in London in 1626; moreover,
Franklin forgot those <cite>Moral Distichs</cite> of Cato and James Logan
which he himself had issued in 1735.</p>

<p>In 1748, Franklin formed a partnership with an alert young
Scotchman whom he had engaged five years before, and the
"Franklin and Hall" imprint thereupon replaced (with a few
exceptions) the familiar "B. Franklin." A few earlier connections
must be mentioned. Franklin's name is found on several
German titles in combination with that of Gotthard Armbruester
and with that of Johannes Böhm, and, apparently once
only, with that of Johannes Wüster, but these seem to have been
purely partnerships of convenience, and suggest no such dual
affiliations as those with Meredith and Hall. The Hall partnership
lasted eighteen years, and during that period Franklin's
connection with printing and publishing became less and less
important as the crisis in international affairs that was bringing
on the American Revolution grew more and more acute. But
the printer in him could not wholly be suppressed. When he
went to Paris in 1776 as representative of the colonies, he established
a little press for his own amusement at his home in Passy,
then a suburb, now as much a part of the metropolis as Greenwich
Village is of New York. It was not quite such a toy as
Robert Louis Stevenson and his stepson Lloyd Osbourne were
one day to set up in Switzerland, the main difference being that
the Stevenson-Osbourne combination knew nothing about printing
and was joyously aware of it, whereas Franklin, with just as
joyous awareness, knew as much about it as any man of his time.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[Pg 365]</span>
One factor the two private presses of Passy and Davos-Platz have
in common&mdash;their productions are excessively rare and costly
collector's playthings. The story of the French venture is authoritatively
set forth in Luther S. Livingston's <cite>Franklin and His
Press at Passy</cite>, issued by the Grolier Club of New York in 1914.
Livingston listed thirty-two entries, and since his monograph
was published six others have come to light, according to Will
Ransom's <cite>Private Presses and Their Books</cite> (New York, 1929).</p>

<p>The output of Franklin's press from 1729 to the termination
of the Hall partnership (1766) is statistically impressive. The
following summary is tabulated from the short-title check list
of all Franklin imprints known in 1918 which Dr. Campbell
appended to the Curtis catalogue (excluding <cite>The Pennsylvania
Gazette</cite> and the numerous issues of paper currency printed by
Franklin from 1731 to 1764):</p>

<p>Any book, pamphlet, broadside, or periodical that bears a
Franklin imprint, alone or in combination, is worth treasuring
on that account alone. In general, the scale of desirability is set
by scarcity, this scale one might suppose, should follow the line
of chronology with reasonable accuracy, but it happens that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[Pg 366]</span>
does not. The Sewell <cite>History</cite>, for instance, ought by chronological
measurement to be an excessively rare book as the first
book on which Franklin worked as an independent printer, and
rare it assuredly is, but by no means to the point of utter
elusiveness.</p>

<p>Twelve years later the total of Franklin imprints was moving
toward two hundred&mdash;and in that twelfth year, 1740, there issued
from his press the second edition of David Evan's <cite>A Short,
Plain Help for Parents and Heads of Families, to Feed Their
Babes with the Sincere Milk of God's Word. Being a Short,
Plain Catechism, Grounded Upon God's Word, and Agreeable
to the Westminster Assembly's Excellent Catechism.</cite> No copy of
the first edition is known to be extant&mdash;Dr. Campbell quoted
the title imperfectly from a contemporary advertisement&mdash;and
neither Hildeburn nor Campbell knew that a second edition
had ever been issued. Neither did anyone else until 1929, when
a copy came to light and won its way to a New York book-seller's
catalogue. The book is mentioned here, not because it possesses
great intrinsic importance (it would be of trivial note if a hundred
or two copies of it survived), but as an indication of the
fact that unrecorded Franklin imprints are likely to appear at
any time, and as indication, further, that the scarcity of Franklin
imprints does not altogether parallel the dates of his activity as
printer and publisher.</p>

<p>In these notes it has been necessary to neglect Franklin, the
author (save as Poor Richard), in favor of Franklin, the printer
and publisher. But it would be an effrontery to allude even
briefly to Franklin without mention of the <cite>Autobiography</cite>. Begun
in 1771 in the quiet charm of an English country-seat, the
first great American classic never was completed. The manuscript
first appeared in print, by an odd series of accidents, in
French in 1791. Subsequently Franklin's grandson, William
Temple Franklin, issued it in a Bowdlerized English version
that would have afforded the old man quiet and somewhat indignant
laughter. The text was not definitely published until
1868, soon after John Bigelow had come into possession of the
original manuscript.</p>

<p>Franklin's epitaph is easily the most familiar in American history,
and almost as well-known a document, perhaps, as Lincoln's
Gettysburg Address. It is not generally known, however, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[Pg 367]</span>
the original version of it was composed in 1728, the very year in
which its author, a youth of twenty-two, entered into partnership
with Meredith. The version written in that year, which
differs in minor details from the final draft, was this:</p>

<p>The printing office was a long narrow room over a store. One
front window was appropriated to a cubicle known as "the
office"&mdash;seldom used, its desk piled high with galley proofs and
dusty government reports. Frames for type cases occupied the
two remaining front windows and the three at the back. In between
were the hand-power cylinder press, the two Gordon
jobbers, an imposing stone for the newspaper and one for job
work. Along the walls ran the dump&mdash;sloping shelves divided
longitudinally by strips of wood, holding galleys and standing
jobs tied up with white packthread. The prevalent odor was a
mixture of benzine and warm roller composition familiar to old-time
printers, but sweeter than the scents of Araby to the young
apprentice about to be initiated into the craft and mystery of
printing.</p>

<p>They seated him on a high stool before a case in the darker part
of the room, with a composing stick, a setting rule, and a piece of
patent medicine reprint. A slug on a string hung on his upper case
to hold the copy in place, for the oldest rule of the printing trade
is "follow copy though it goes out the window." In each corner
of the lower case boxes Big Sweeny, the foreman, had stuck letters
from a job font to guide the youngster in learning the case.</p>

<p>For days the tyro was absorbed in the seemingly impossible
task of setting a stick full of type and "dumping" it on the galley.
The first lot exploded in the air; it took hours to distribute the
"pi."</p>

<p>In a few weeks he had learned his case, except the small boxes
around the edge, double ffls and ffis and little-used punctuation
points. He could distinguish a 3-em space from a 5-em, and justify
a line by distributing them judiciously, remembering, as was often
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[Pg 369]</span>impressed on him, to put more space between words ending in
tall letters. He began to look about him and take stock of the curious
world in which he found himself.</p>

<p>For years he had dreamed of printing, his appetite whetted by
the life of Franklin in the Harper Story Books, and a manual of
instructions for young printers in the same volume. He pored
over type specimen books obtained from Barnhart Brothers &amp;
Spindler, and reveled in the amazing faces shown. Other boys had
their ambitions&mdash;firemen, policemen, railroad engineer&mdash;but his
hero was the journeyman printer, a green shade over his eyes,
sleeves rolled to display a bright red undershirt, spitting tobacco
with an accuracy that missed nothing but the spittoon. Tales told
by typographical tourists, the tramp printers, were his folklore,
and for some years after he learned his trade his chance to work
came mostly in "subbing" for printers frankly laying off to get
drunk.</p>

<p>Type had two names. He was setting brevier Roman; the
smaller size used for quotations and for county correspondence
was nonpareil. Other sizes with equally picturesque names piqued
his curiosity. In the early eighties the point system had not reached
the prairies. Later he became familiar with it. The old names of
the types with approximate sizes in points that prevailed in the
days of our young apprentice were as follows:</p>

<p>Diamond, 4-1/2-point; Pearl, 5-point; Agate, 5-1/2-point; Nonpareil,
6-point; Minion, 7-point; Brevier, 8-point; Bourgeois, 9-point;
Long Primer, 10-point; Small Pica, 11-point; Pica, 12-point;
English, 14-point; Columbian, 16-point; Great Primer,
18-point; Paragon, 20-point; Double Pica (strictly this should
be Double Small Pica), 22-point; Two-line Pica, 24-point; Two-line
English, 28-point; Two-line Great Primer, 36-point; Two-line
Double Pica, 44-point; Canon, 48-point.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that all these sizes were found in the
office of the Book &amp; Job Print, nor for that matter probably anywhere
but in the warehouses of Barnhart Bros. &amp; Spindler,
Marder, Luse &amp; Co., MacKellar, Smiths &amp; Jordan Co., Bruce, or
other type-founders.</p>

<p>Our apprentice was afflicted with one of those curious prying
minds that sought to know the reason for all things. Much typographical
history lurked behind the names given to type sizes.
<em>Diamond</em>, <em>agate</em> and <em>nonpareil</em>, it seemed, were merely fancy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[Pg 370]</span>
names, but <em>brevier</em> was so-called because it had been used to print
breviaries; <em>canon</em>, from the first lines of the canonical mass, and
<em>primer</em> for primaries or elementary prayer books. <em>Bourgeois</em> has
been attributed to the city of Bourges, to a printer named Bourgeois,
and to having been used in cheap books for the middle
classes, the bourgeoisie. <em>Minion</em> was said to be the French word
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mignon</i>, darling. But the origin of <em>pica</em>, so constantly used as a
yardstick for measuring leads, slugs, reglets, and the width of
columns and pages, is as fascinating as it is baffling.</p>

<p><em>Pica</em> is Latin for magpie, and it has been ingeniously supposed
that some work now lost, an account of that thievish and mischievous
bird, was printed in type now bearing that name. De Vinne<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
cites a far more amusing derivation: "Like great primer, pica takes
its name from its early use as a text letter. 'The Pie,' writes
Mores, 'was a table showing the course of the service of the
church in the time of darkness. It was called the Pie because it
was written in letters of black and red, as the Friars de Pica were
so named from their party-colored raiment black and white, the
plumage of the magpie.'" And is it not at least probable that "pi,"
a jumble of unsorted type, is also derived from the same source,
either because of the pied feathers of the bird, or from its habit
of assembling a miscellaneous collection of objects in some hiding
place?</p>

<p>As he explored his upper case, our apprentice discovered that
while the capitals and small capitals were ranged in alphabetical
order, <em>J</em> and <em>U</em> were left to the end like substitute ball players on
the bench. By studying an unabridged dictionary he learned that
those letters were late comers into the alphabet; the old scribes,
finding that <em>I</em> tended to become confused with the last stroke
of the previous letter, gave it a tail to distinguish it. The two forms
were used indiscriminately for the consonant and vowel sounds
of <em>I</em> until in due course they were separated. In the same way <em>V</em>
was half of <em>W</em>, distinguished as singleyou and doubleyou. <em>V</em> was
carelessly written as <em>U</em> and even as <em>Y</em>, and had all the sounds, but
was at length assigned one job, and the <em>U</em> added to the alphabet.
How long ago that happened! So conservative was the printing
art that even after two hundred years the case had not been
shifted to accommodate them, and dictionaries as late as 1800
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[Pg 371]</span>still used both forms in the same classification. Our apprentice
felt that the office where he was learning his trade had not
changed greatly, typographically at least, since Plantin.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The number and variety of faces at the disposal of the master
printer equalled their ugliness, though this apprentice considered
them all beautiful. There were of course the Roman faces, some
of which were good, and still are, but these were strangely distorted
as condensed, extra-condensed, extended, expanded, as
well as shaded, open, skeleton, contour, sloped (both ways),
ornamented, and hair-line letters.</p>

<p>One would think these were enough for all the printing anyone
would want to do, but there was also a bewildering multitude of
so-called job types of fancy and fantastic design. Each foundry
put out a book as big as a dictionary, filled with bizarre creations
in which the innocent alphabet was twisted and tormented and
decorated until some of its masterpieces were illegible.</p>

<p>Among them were a number informally standardized and cast
by all foundries. Such were Antique, Boldface, Gothic, Lightface,
Clarendon, Caledonian, Ionic, Doric, Egyptian, Runic, Celtic,
Rustic, Script, Grecian, Monastic, Norman, Title, and these too
were also condensed, extended and otherwise squeezed, stretched
and pulled about. When the type-writer came there was added
that monstrosity, type-writer type. But the pride of each foundry
was its own exclusive creations, to which were given names as
fantastic as the designs, putting Pullman nomenclature to shame,
such as Pansy, Olive, Asteroid, Van Dyke, Vulcan, Schwabacher,
Florist, Teuton, Text, Eastlake.</p>

<p>From such an array the country printer was expected to choose
the types to equip his shop. His outfit consisted of fair quantities
of Roman, nonpareil, brevier and long primer for straight matter&mdash;the
weekly newspaper, booklets and pamphlets, with larger sizes
for job work, too many faces with few fonts large enough to
set more than a line or two. This did not matter since it seemed
obligatory to set in a different letter each line of display, advertisements,
title pages, as well as dodgers and handbills, the greater
the contrast and variety the better, with "ands" and "thes" in
lines by themselves, centered and flanked by flourishes on each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[Pg 372]</span>
side. Type larger than two-line canon was made of wood, and was
called "stud-horse type" because used for the big bills tacked up
on barns and trees to advertise the services of a stallion.</p>

<p>Small fonts of job type were listed in foundry catalogues "5A
13a," to indicate quantity, other letters being in proportion. There
was seldom more than one of little used letters, necessitating a shift
to another font when a line turned up with two Xs or two Zs.
Job types were laid in cases like the uppers of Roman, the boxes
all of a size, capitals on one side, lower case on the other.</p>

<p>New type was an abomination. The compositor's fingers, already
tender from the lye used to wash forms, were cut by the
sharp edges, and his eyes blinded by the glare from sorts, and the
printers were forever prowling the shining metal. There was
chronic clack of up and down the live bank with tweezers, pulling
out the needed letters, and inserting an equal-sized type upside
down to mark the place. Another source of trouble was the font
from a different foundry, supposedly the same body, but with
a slight variation, that was forever getting into the wrong case
and being set up, dropping out when the form was lifted.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The apprentice was kept too busy to have much time for the
acquisition of abstract knowledge. In return for instruction in the
art and mystery of printing he was expected to perform the duties
of a "devil." He arrived at half-past six, started the fire in the pot-bellied
stove, swept up (no light job, for the continuous barrage
of fine-cut and plug formed a coping around the feet of every
frame, and the trimmings from the big knife lay in windrows).
All day he ran errands with proofs, handbills, billheads, advertisements,
to submit to customers; wet down paper for the weekly
run of the newspaper, and pasted the subscribers' names on them
for the mail; distributed "pi," and rushed the growler for thirsty
journeymen.</p>

<p>But he learned that the printers in one shop were a "chapel," the
head was the "father," who was not the foreman. It thrilled him
that such expressions went back to the time when Caxton had
his press in Westminster Abbey. A small group of men working
on the same job was a companionship, and had strict rules as to
who was to do what. Points of procedure, such as the first or a
"fat take," or the selection of a victim to set up the beer, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[Pg 373]</span>
determined by a curious custom. The men gathered around the
imposing stone, and each in turn shook out a few em-quads, five
or seven, throwing them on the stone like dice. The one with the
most nicks uppermost was the winner.</p>

<p>These were time-honored practices, but each shop had customs
peculiar to itself. He learned not to whistle at his case, for a sponge
of dirty water was apt to take him squarely in the mouth. When
late he found lines set up in his composing stick, which he had
to distribute before he began work, at his own expense&mdash;when he
was finally promoted to piece work,&mdash;</p>


<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"> <em>A diller, a dollar, a ten-o'clock scholar,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 1em; ">What makes you come so soon?</span><br />
You used to come at ten o'clock,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 1em; ">But now you come at noon.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>


<p>For some time his tormentors had alluded mysteriously to the
"type louse" that haunted the forms, and promised to show him
one when found. A journeyman working at the stone over a newspaper
form wet down for distribution called him over, and pointing
excitedly, cried,</p>

<p>"Now, there, look!"</p>

<p>He looked.</p>

<p>Handfuls of type had been removed, and the water gathered
in small pools between the columns. The apprentice bent over
eagerly to behold the strange insect, whereupon the journeyman
shoved up a column of type, forcing the water to rise like a
fountain into the apprentice's innocent face, while the force
roared with laughter and pounded with their composing sticks on
the frames.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>In a small office in pre-union days, every printer was or became
an "all-round" man. Not only could he stick type (and some old-time
printers had a wonderful instinct for spacing), but he could
"kick" a jobber, impose, make ready, and feed a cylinder press.
Some of the vagabond printers who drifted back and forth across
the West, working a few days at each halt, were not only craftsmen
but characters. It was amazing how promptly they became
at home in a strange shop, in a few moments working as if they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[Pg 374]</span>
had been there for years. The saga of the typographic tourist has
yet to be told.</p>

<p>It was not long before he found himself standing on one leg
like a stork, working the treadle of the Gordon jobber with the
other, feeding some small job, milk tickets or dodgers or billheads,
against three 3-em quads pasted to the tympan in lieu of gaugepins.
As the press had no grippers the feeder must grab the printed
sheet before the ink pulled it off and insert the next, regulating
the speed according to his need. Pasting scraps of cardboard on
the quads to project a bit helped hold the printed card or paper.
The regular gaugepins sold never seemed to work as well as
quads, and anyway, old-time printers were self-helpful and
never bought what they could make.</p>

<p>From feeding press he graduated to making ready and locking
up forms. There were always enough odds and ends of furniture
for small jobs without cutting new, but for big work, particularly
a book or pamphlet, the furniture was cut to fit the job. The form
was "locked" by driving quoins, wedge-shaped bits of hard wood,
along the tapering side sticks with an implement known as a
shooting stick, notched at one end. The form was planed with a
block of wood beaten over the form to drive down type that
might stick above the printing surface. Something like this still
prevails, no doubt, but not with such primitive tools, and very
little printing is now done from the type. I am sure the shooting
stick and wooden quoins must be as obsolete as ink balls.</p>

<p>The night before the newspaper was run off, the paper was
laid down on a broad platform, a quire at a time, drenched with
water, covered with a wide board, and a heavy stone placed on
top to squeeze the water out. Dampening was necessary to make
the ink stick. Subscribers received their papers so wet they had to
dry them before reading. The press was a cylinder with a large
flywheel having a handle attached. It was run by human power&mdash;a
husky Negro, who also furnished the muscle for the big knife,
or guillotine, with which books were trimmed. In the words of
the proprietor he "always gives a scent back no matter what we
pay him." The apprentice and devil doubled for the porter when
he was otherwise engaged, but shortly steam was installed, adding
greatly to the excitement on press day.</p>

<p>Feeding the dampened sheets against the gripper was not easy,
and often he missed. To stop the press he grasped the long switch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[Pg 375]</span>
lever and threw the overhead belt on to the idle pulley. If it failed,
as it sometimes did, the tympan was inked, and several sheets must
be run through before it ceased to offset on the wrong side of the
paper, a waste of which his employer made him emphatically
aware. It had been easier to stop the press when it was turned by
hand.</p>

<p>A daily chore which fell to his lot cruelly sharpened the appetite
of a hungry boy toward the noon hour. This was the menu card
from the local hotel with corrections for the day's dinner (square
meal, 25 cents). He picked up the standing type, slid it on a
galley, and proceeded to pull out yesterday's banana fritter and
stewed corn and insert today's pear fritter and stewed tomatoes.
He then ran off thirty copies, taking extra care as the stock was
special and had the word <em>Menu</em> embossed in gold and other decorations.
It was a sort of Barmecide's feast for him, whetting an
appetite that needed no whetting.</p>

<p>Every printing office boasted one of those geniuses expert at
rule twisting, who with shears, file and pliers bent brass rule into
patterns that would print scrolls and flourishes around headlines
and on title pages, ornaments for the corners of boxes, and when
needed extra long braces. Some could create intricate designs,
birds with streamers in their beaks in which type could be set,
like those that were the pride of the writing masters. Like leads,
brass rule was bought in lengths of a foot or so, and cut as needed.
Much ingenuity was required to make the corners meet, until
the arrival of "labor-saving," with corners mitered or beveled.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>When work in the printing office became slack he was moved
to the bindery, where the files of Godey's, Peterson's and Ballou's
Magazines were put in dull black covers with names lettered on
the spine. Its principal work, however, was the manufacture of
account books, made to order to fit the individual book-keeping
methods of bank or merchant. The ancient ruling machine of
mahogany looked something like a loom for weaving cloth. Until
the advent of loose-leaf books and adding machines, business men
kept their accounts in three enormous tomes labeled respectively
Day Book, Journal, and Ledger. Every transaction was entered
in the Day Book chronologically. It was reëntered in the Journal
to separate outgo from income. Finally, each item appeared in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[Pg 376]</span>
the Ledger under the name of the customer, or creditor, to show
the status of individual accounts.</p>

<p>Sheets of paper, bearing picturesque old names&mdash;Royal, Crown,
Demy, or Foolscap&mdash;were fed to the ruling machine, and came
into contact with a battery of pens, each with its own little fountain
of ink, red or blue, as the line demanded&mdash;both colors ruled
at once. The sheets were then printed at the top of each page with
the name of the firm, numbered by hand, and bound in the familiar
heavy books, with covers half an inch thick, hinges of
rawhide, red leather backs and corners, and sides decorated with
marbled paper.</p>

<p>The marbled paper was made in the shop. A square tray or
pan of slate was filled with a thin sizing of water and gum tragacanth.
On its surface were gently shaken little blobs of color
that spread slowly on the surface of the pool. The fashion in blank
books seemed to run to red, blue and white. The spots of color
were combed into the wavy patterns peculiar to such books. A
sheet of paper laid on the surface of the water took off a fine
impression of the pattern. These sheets were used for end-papers
as well as covers. The edges of the book were also marbled. All
this was once done in a small printing office in a prairie town of
about 12,000 inhabitants. The books were sturdy and durable. I
have seen many of them preserved in vaults beneath banks, filled
with the neat Spencerian hand of the bookkeepers of that era, the
pupils of the writing masters who drew without taking pen from
paper the flowing florid birds trailing messages from their bills.</p>

<p>He was for some years a "two-thirder." A two-thirder received
two-thirds the wages of a journeyman printer, which were fifteen
dollars a week. They did not have piece work at the Book &amp; Job
Print, but later he entered another world, worked on the evening
newspaper of the town and tasted the excitement of a race against
bogie, the average day's work of ten thousand ems, the printer's
measure familiar to all crossword puzzle fans. The piece rate was
twenty-five cents a thousand, whether leaded brevier or solid
nonpareil. A rapid compositor could set ten or more thousand a
day, according to luck with "takes." One learned the fine art of
jockeying for position, slowing up when the next take on the
hook, was an undesirable one, or speeding in the race for a fat one.
Fat takes were pickups&mdash;railroad time table, baseball score, market
report, taken from the live bank, corrected and added to one's<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[Pg 377]</span>
string to be paid for as if set. Each compositor had a numbered
slug that he dumped on the galley with his stickful of set matter.
When the galley was proved he kept a copy, and at the end of
the day pasted up his work, being careful to join the takes closely,
signed his name and turned it in. As soon as the paper was up
there was a let-down, the tension relaxed, pipes were lit, conversation
was possible, and the men picked up incredibly long handfuls
of type from the forms returned from the pressroom, and proceeded
to throw in a thumping big case against next day's work.</p>

<p>Cuts, if any, were of wood. There was an engraver in the town
who supplied illustrations when badly enough needed and plenty
of time was available. He made both the drawing and the block,
and was a better engraver than artist. His pictures were what is
now modernist and even surrealist. An ingenious method of making
cuts in an emergency was nipped in the bud by the progress
of zinc etching. That was the chalk plate. A metal plate coated
with a film of chalk could be drawn on with a sharp instrument,
cutting through the chalk to the plate. The plate was then used
as a matrix to make a casting that would print the lines drawn,
something after the manner of a stereotype.</p>

<p>But the pride of the country press was its stock of ready-made
cuts&mdash;Lodge emblems: Masonic, Odd Fellows, I.O.G.T.; patriotic:
eagle, star, flag, Liberty Bell; trade symbols: mortar and
pestle, false teeth, piano, anvil, watch, domestic animals, together
with the inevitable pointing finger (fist) and clasped hands. There
were houses, ships, buggies, and, even still on hand in some offices,
runaway slaves. These were used to embellish circulars, invitations,
or programs, and were also used in small ads in the newspaper.</p>

<p>There were molds for casting rollers that looked much like
huge candle molds. The roller composition was a mixture of glue
and molasses, consistency varying according to the season of the
year. It was more practicable to buy rollers by this time, but
homemade rollers were still cast occasionally. In a near-by village
as late as 1889 a four-column folio weekly newspaper was run off&mdash;pulled,
I should say&mdash;on a hand-lever press, one page at a time,
the same method and almost the same press as that which printed
the <cite>Virginia Gazette</cite>, or the earlier <cite>Saturday Evening Post</cite>, or
for that matter all incunabula.</p>

<p>It is quite likely that all the old-time editors of country news<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[Pg 378]</span>papers
were printers. The tradition no longer holds, but one apprentice
printer in my old shop whose destiny was no doubt
influenced by this early contact with type was John Finley, who
became editor of the country's greatest newspaper. There are
still men, though not so many as there were once, playing important
roles in world affairs who at some time in their lives experienced
the thrill of handling the twenty-four (now twenty-six)
potent little lead soldiers that change the history of the world.
No man ever loses that sense of the importance of printing, or can
look upon a printed thing with indifference, who has once felt
it. Nor for that matter does he ever forget the lay of the case. It
is a craft that gets into the blood.</p>

<p>In 1889 or thereabouts I witnessed a scene which foretold the
great change that was coming to the art I had learned with such
patience and diligence, as revolutionary as the change of shipping
from sail to steam. There arrived and was set up a machine intended
to set type. Its name was Thorne, and its principle was to
release the letter called for when the key was pressed by means
of nicks in the body of the type, like the tumblers of a Yale lock.
The type travelled in the channels to a galley, and was justified
by hand, if I remember rightly. Obviously the device depended
upon a hair-trigger nicety of adjustment. Even the mechanics
who came with it had difficulty in making it work. It jammed
repeatedly, and before many hours the floor was covered with
broken sorts. After a few months it was packed up and sent back,
and the old-fashioned method of setting by hand was reinstated,
until that day when that office, like every one of its class, was
equipped with a battery of linotypes. Thus vanished a craft that
had been four hundred years in the making, that uncanny skill
with which a good printer manipulated type.</p>

<p>The tramp printer, with his thirst, his steel setting rule, his
budget of gossip of all the printing offices in a wide territory, has
become extinct. The callous forefinger of the printer is as much a
legend as the miller's sensitive thumb.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Did they print books in those far-away prairie printing offices?
They certainly did. One of the rarest items of Western Americana
bears a Galesburg imprint. A pioneer of that town, a genius who
played the flute and made many inventions, one of them the rotary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[Pg 379]</span>
plow still used to clear snow from the tracks of western railroads,
was Riley Root. In 1849 he caught the gold fever and made the
trip to Oregon and California over-land in a covered wagon. He
had many adventures, and on his return wrote a book that was
printed in Galesburg and is now a collector's item. A famous Boston
book-seller became excited when he discovered a copy. "Unknown,"
he wrote in 1932, "to Wagner, Smith, Cowan, or as far
as we know to any other bibliographer of the West, and unrecorded
in the entire run of American Book Prices Current."</p>

<p>The front wrapper reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Journal of Travels / from / St. Josephs to Oregon / with /
observations of that country / together with / a Description
of California, / its agricultural interests, / and / a full description
/ of / its Gold Mines. / By Riley Root / Galesburg, Ill.
/ Intelligencer Print / 1850.</p></div>

<p>The matter on the wrapper is repeated on the title page with
some minor variations. The book is a substantial pamphlet, size
9-1/2 by 6 inches, 144 pages, uncut. The Boston bookman continues:</p>

<p>"Riley Root's Journal has everything that a rare piece of Western
Americana should have. In the first place, it <em>looks</em> rare. Like
several rare Western items of which only a few copies exist, it was
printed in a small mid-Western town. 'Galesburg, Illinois, 1850'
is an imprint that has charm for the collector."</p>

<p>It must be excessively rare. The only other copy of which I
know, besides the one described, is now appropriately in the
Seymour Library of Knox College. Of this copy the librarian
said (when he acknowledged the gift to the Library in 1931):</p>

<p>"This little unbound pamphlet was written by Riley Root who
came with his family to this prairie country in 1836, when he was
37 years old, and helped to build the houses of Log City, the forerunner
of Galesburg.... It was printed in Galesburg in 1850 by
the 'Intelligencer Print' and bears in the border of the cover the
name of the compositor, Southwick Davis, who graduated from
Knox in the first class&mdash;that of 1846. This creditable piece of printing
was done only about fourteen years after Galesburg was
staked out and when Knox College was graduating its fifth class.</p>

<p>"In April 1848 Riley Root left Galesburg to make this over-land
journey, crossing the continent by way of the Oregon Trail
to Oregon City, a distance of 1846 miles from St. Josephs on the
Missouri River, which was regarded as the starting point for the
long journey through the Indian Country. Although gold had
been discovered at Sutter's sawmill in California on February
10th, 1848, nearly two months before Mr. Root left Galesburg,
it is not probable that he learned of that famous event until he
reached Oregon in mid-September. The news spread slowly even
on the Pacific coast, credible reports reaching San Francisco only
in May. Mr. Root says that the excitement ('yellow fever,' he calls
it) began in Oregon about the middle of August, and that within
one month nearly 2,000 persons left Oregon for the gold fields.
The purpose of Mr. Root's over-land journey to Oregon is not
stated, but it would seem from an entry in his diary seven months
after reaching Oregon City, to the effect that he had been 'roaming
up and down the valley, in pursuit of information,' that he was
scouting for new lands on a new frontier. Finding himself in the
midst of all the gold rush 'commotion' he may very well have been
attacked by the 'yellow fever' bug himself. At any rate he left
Oregon in April, 1849, just a year after leaving Galesburg, and
going to San Francisco and the California gold fields, spent five
months, returning to Illinois by way of Panama and New Orleans.
He arrived in Galesburg, January 8, 1850.</p>

<p>"This little pamphlet records the details of this epic journey,
and if Riley Root's reputation rested on this alone he would take
high rank as a historian. It is extremely well done and is a faithful
journal of not only the day to day happenings, but of the country
and its climate, the wild animals, the Indians, the geology and
botany, the mountains, the forests and streams, and many other
features that give evidence of the observant eye of the author.
One interesting and important chapter relates the harrowing details
of the Indian massacre of November, 1847, in which Dr.
Marcus Whitman and his wife lost their lives. This story was supplied
to Mr. Root by eye-witnesses and is said to be its earliest
publication in book or pamphlet form."</p>

<p>Among the many changes of ownership of presses in Galesburg,
it would be difficult to decide whether the shop in which I
learned my trade was a descendant of the Intelligencer Print or
not, but it was produced in just such a primitive and resourceful
plant.</p>

too easily from the pen. They cover an

reporter, with an interim case-history
of a particular author, a particular
printer and a healthy body of
work in progress.</p>


<p>Our author is George Bernard Shaw,
sometime of Dublin: our printer, R. &amp;
R. Clark, now, as always, of Edinburgh.
The association is unique in more than a geographical
sense; in time it covers fifty years; in space it defies quantitative
analysis. Bernard Shaw's quota, if consigned to the Society of
Authors, would probably make that body independent of the
publishing trade for years to come.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[Pg 382]</span></p>
<p>Miss Marjorie Plant has pointed out, in her always readable
economic history, <cite>The English Book Trade</cite>, that there was once
a time when "the person who was of no account whatever in the
early years of the book industry was the author." At a later period
when the printer was dominated by book-seller and publisher,
Dr. Johnson wrote in <cite>The Gentleman's Magazine</cite> in 1739, "We
can produce some who threatened printers with their highest
displeasure for having dared to print books for those who wrote
them!"</p>

<p>In the history of English literature the relations of author,
printer and publisher have often been bitter and obscure, posing
many problems in bibliography and textual criticism. Dr.
McKerrow, introducing the literary student to bibliography, suggests
that "the best way of obtaining a clear and lively comprehension
of the processes by which the books of Shakespeare's
time were produced" would be by actually composing a sheet
or two in exact facsimile of an Elizabethan quarto and printing
it on a hand-press. "Once he does this," he adds, "he will find
that the material book, apart altogether from its literary content,
can be a thing of surprising interest."</p>

<p>The surprise of Dr. McKerrow's student trying to disentangle
the impositions by which the Penguin edition of more than a
million copies of Shaw's plays were produced on modern perfector
printing presses and automatic folding machines would
indeed be considerable. Nevertheless it is to be doubted whether
there are as many bibliographical vagaries and obscurities in
Shaw as in the folios and quartos of Shakespeare. Certainly
there is something of the same fascination in the printing and
production of the "material" books of the later playwright; apart
from the literary antics of an ebullient Irish author with that
most emotional of all romantic characters: seemingly hard-headed
Scots printers.</p>

<p>Since we are presenting the romance of playwright and
printer, without benefit of publisher, let us set our characters in
their dramatic place and scene. The place is Edinburgh; the
scene R. &amp; R. Clark; the principal characters, Edward Clark,
Bernard Shaw and William Maxwell; with a faint echo off-stage
from that habitual bankrupt, Grant Richards, later deserted for
the more solid attractions of a "commissioned" Constable.</p>

<p>Professor G. M. Trevelyan, in one of those two brilliant chapters
on Scotland in his <cite>English Social History</cite>, points out that
rapidly developing eighteenth-century Edinburgh "was hardly
less important than London in the British field of letters."</p>

<p>Mr. Stanley Morison, speaking in Edinburgh in 1944 on the
subject of <cite>The Typographic Arts</cite>, pointed out that the first history
of typography ever written for the instruction of the trade
was James Watson's <cite>The Art of Printing</cite>, published in Edinburgh
in 1713.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> A few years later the Edinburgh book-seller, Alexander
Donaldson, who set up shop in the Strand and put Edinburgh
printed classics on sale at 30 per cent to 50 per cent below the
usual prices, was largely responsible for the creation of a "permanent
and enlarged printing and type-founding industry in Edinburgh."
Mr. Morison also asserts that in the last quarter of the
eighteenth century Scotland led the interest in technicalities
of printing.</p>

<p>The first edition of the <cite>Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite>, printed in
Edinburgh in 1771, was brought out by "a Society of Gentlemen
of Scotland." John Bell's <cite>British Poets</cite> and <cite>British Theatre</cite> were
printed at the Apollo Press by Gilbert Martin, an Edinburgh
printer of whom Mr. Morison would gladly know more.</p>

<p>"The social, imaginative and intellectual life" of Scotland in
the early nineteenth century centred largely in Edinburgh on
Burns and Scott, Adam Smith and <cite>The Edinburgh Review</cite>. The
familiar publisher names, Ballantyne, Blackwood, Chambers,
Constable, Nelson, were also printers. In type-founding, Miller
&amp; Richards' Scotch Roman cut in 1803, and the later Old Style,
were widely used throughout the trade, at home and abroad,
right up to the present day.</p>

<p>It was in 1846, six years before Alexander Phemister cut the
now famous Old Style, that Robert Clark, with a loan of £200,
laid the modest foundations of R. &amp; R. Clark. After serving his
apprenticeship in Montrose as compositor and pressman (what
is called in the Edinburgh trade a "twicer") he sought experi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[Pg 385]</span>ence
in London as a journeyman, before returning to Edinburgh
to start his own business. His London experience must have been
of some value to him because it was not long before he and his
partner, James Kirkwood, had developed an active business with
London publishers: Macmillans, Bentley, John Murray, Smith
Elder, A. &amp; C. Black, amongst others.</p>


<p>Robert Clark's policy of providing fine quality, with conscientious
service at the highest possible price, no doubt contributed
to the financial success of a rapidly developing business which
moved to the present printing works at Brandon Street in 1883.
Robert Clark's only surviving son, Edward, took over sole control
after his father's death in 1894. William Maxwell first
appears on the scene at this time, entering R. &amp; R. Clark as a
shorthand writer in 1892.</p>

<p>It was in 1892 that Shaw's first play, <cite>Widowers' Houses</cite>, was
produced; 1898 when <cite>Plays Pleasant and Unpleasant</cite>, published
by Grant Richards, were printed by R. &amp; R. Clark.</p>

<p>Few living authors nowadays can claim continuous direct relations
with one printer over a period of fifty years. Books are now
the product of mechanical composing machines, automatic printing
presses, and mechanized binderies. They require expert
control by experienced production staffs dealing with many different
paper-makers, printers and binders. For this reason alone
the printed works of such a productive author as Bernard Shaw
are a remarkable exception to the general rule in the highly-organized
printing and publishing trades.</p>

<p>Commission publishing is the resort of authors whose reputation
guarantees a lucrative circulation and who can afford the
necessary capital. Shaw now deals directly with his printer and
binder, buying and paying for his own composition, machining,
paper and binding.</p>

<p>Shaw had always very definite ideas about the format of his
books and, with the complete and friendly co-operation of his
present publisher, has dealt continuously with R. &amp; R. Clark
since 1898. Clarks are now 102, Shaw 92, Maxwell 75; this unique
association of author and printer is also a competition in longevity.</p>

<p>The influence of Bernard Shaw on our time has been profound;
in the theatre, in films and in broadcasting. The circulation of his
printed works has been immense. His direct collaboration with
his printer over a long period is of more than professional interest
to publishers, printers and bibliographers. This unique
author-printer relationship provides an unusual aspect for us of
the wit, vigour and working methods of one of the most successful
authors and playwrights of our time; demonstrating also in
no uncertain terms the integrity, craftsmanship and mechanical
resource of the printing house of R. &amp; R. Clark, so soundly based
and flexibly developed over the last hundred years in the solid
traditions of the Edinburgh book-printing trade.</p>

<p>In 1946, on the occasion of the centenary of R. &amp; R. Clark,
Shaw wrote of that renowned Edinburgh printing firm, "Ever
since it printed my first plays, <cite>Pleasant and Unpleasant</cite>, in 1898,
it has been as natural a part of my workshop as the pen in my
hand." Few printers can ever have received so eloquent a tribute
from so eminent an author.</p>

<p>As a young author, Shaw's experiences with publishers had
not been exactly encouraging. Between 1879 and 1883, as regularly
as clockwork, at the rate of one a year, they rejected all his
novels. The climate in publishing at that time is best described
by Shaw himself writing to Daniel Macmillan in 1943. The letter
is quoted in full in Charles Morgan's <cite>The House of Macmillan</cite>;
a small portion bears reprinting here. After describing how
Meredith turned him down for Chatto's without extenuating
circumstances; how Blackwood accepted his first novel but reneged;
how Smith Elder were polite and asked to see future
efforts, Shaw goes on to write: "I am now one of the few who
personally remember the Grand Old Men of the publishing
world of that day: Alexander Macmillan, Longmans and Bentley.
They were so powerful that they held the book-sellers in
abject subjection, and were denounced by Walter Besant and
his newly-organized Society of Authors as remorseless sharks.
When they died and were succeeded by their sons, the hereditary
system did not always work as well as it did in Bedford
Street; and the book-sellers got the upper hand. John Murray's<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[Pg 388]</span>
Byronic prestige was so select that I did not dream of trying him
until years later, when I was an author of some note and had
already helped to bankrupt three publishers. I offered him <cite>Man
and Superman</cite>. He refused in a letter which really touched me.
He said he was old-fashioned and perhaps a bit behind the
times; but he could not see any intention in my book but to
wound, irritate and upset all established constitutional opinion,
and therefore could not take the responsibility of publishing it.
By that time I could command sufficient capital to finance my
books and enter into direct friendly relations with the printers
(this began my very pleasant relations with Clarks of Edinburgh).
I took matters into my own hands and, like Herbert
Spencer and Ruskin, manufactured my books myself, and induced
Constables to take me "on commission."</p>

<p>Sidney and Beatrice Webb sent Shaw to their Edinburgh
printer. An informative and amusing correspondence reprinted
at length by Grant Richards in <cite>Author Hunting</cite> reveals how he
was ruled and educated by Shaw in the choice of type, "Morris"
margins, specimen pages, paper and other details of production.
Holbrook Jackson has pointed out in an article in number four
of <cite>The Fleuron</cite> that Shaw's books followed the model of William
Morris's <cite>Roots of the Mountains</cite>, printed in Caslon Old Face at
the Chiswick Press in 1892. Shaw, Socialist intimate and admirer
of Morris, was also in close touch with Emery Walker, and familiar
no doubt with the typographical ideas of Morris, Walker
and Cobden-Sanderson, first elaborated in Edinburgh in 1889
at a meeting of the National Association for the Advancement of
Art, and later published in <cite>Arts and Crafts Essays</cite> printed in
Edinburgh in 1893.</p>

<p>In preliminary discussions of the production of <cite>Plays Pleasant
and Unpleasant</cite>, Shaw insisted on a trade union printer. Grant
Richards doubted whether a union house could do justice to his
ideal of the book beautiful. "I had few notions of what makes
a union house," wrote Grant Richards. "I do not think I had a
union house on my list. The problem shifted to the question of
fair wages, and R. &amp; R. Clark were approved." Shaw, in a letter
to Grant Richards in 1897, observed, "Clark is all right; a first-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[Pg 389]</span>rate
house. I enclose a letter which you can hold as a certificate
of compliance with my fair wages clause."...</p>

<p>Edward Clark doubtless also got much entertainment from
his dealings with a teetotal, non-smoking, vegetarian, Socialist
of an author. There is a story that, on one specimen, Shaw's instructions
for close and mechanically-equal spacing between
words were so precisely followed by the pragmatical Scots, that
at the end of some closely spaced lines the definite article "the"
was divided "t-" and "he" turned over, and the indefinite article
"a-" with "n" turned over. Shaw's comment when returning the
specimen, as Maxwell tells the story, was, "Excellent; but please
do not go so far as to prove the author is really a damn fool."
Shaw denies the story; nevertheless, true or untrue, it has a
Shavian flavour.</p>

<p>Shaw's choice of Caslon for his original edition was inevitable.
We know that he picked up the pre-Kelmscott formula ready-made
from William Morris; but, unlike the founding fathers of
the private press movement, he lacked the unearned income to
indulge in a privately-cut type-face. In 1897 we must remember
that there were only two text-types available in most book-houses:
Old Style or Modern. More often than not, before mechanical
type-setting, there was not even any choice. Publisher
and author often had to accept the type of which there happened
to be, at any given moment, the greatest amount of "dis."</p>

<p>Shaw's original hand-set page in type-founder's Caslon, long
primer solid, stood up to thirty years' constant use. To our post-war
eyes, conditioned by authorized economy standards, the
precise and consistent setting of the plays, with their even Roman
small caps, lower-case italics in square brackets, with occasional
lower-case Roman words letter-spaced, has considerable
nostalgic typographical charm. Here is sense and sensibility in
book-making, well ahead of its typographical time. Of course,
there are many people, William Maxwell and Bernard Newdigate
amongst them, who protested that long primer Caslon set
solid was too small and too difficult to read. But Shaw proved
faithful to his original style and to his original setting until the
plates wore out. He liked a colourful block of letter-press with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[Pg 390]</span>out
white "rivers." He complains that modern printing ink is
not black enough.</p>

<p>In the middle twenties when the project of a Limited Collected
Edition was discussed, Shaw still preferred Caslon, but
agreed to a larger size, pica solid, on a larger page, medium
octavo. But, and to William Maxwell it was a considerable but,
Shaw specified hand-setting. As a disciple of William Morris,
Shaw objected to setting his books by machine. Our William
from Edinburgh thereafter called on Shaw with two different
specimen pages, one hand-set in original Caslon and one "machine-justified"
in Monotype Caslon. Both were submitted to
Shaw without saying which was which. The suspected Monotype
"justification" was preferred. Maxwell triumphed. Emery
Walker, consulted by letter, also approved the machine-set page.</p>

<p>What a victory for the machine! Or rather, what a subtle example
of Maxwell's typographical tact and persuasiveness! The
re-setting of the whole of Shaw by hand would have been an
inexcusable and expensive drudgery. Maxwell convinced Shaw
that the mechanical composing machine could equal hand-setting
in typographical quality and close spacing between words
and sentences.</p>

<p>The devotion to Monotype Caslon in the middle twenties
seems strange to us now, looking back from a wealth of typographical
equipment, including Bembo, Bell and Times. But if
we look round the literature of the trade at that time, particularly
at <cite>The Fleuron</cite>, we note that Caslon in its Monotype version
had a vogue, almost a kind of typographical Indian summer.
<cite>The Fleuron</cite> number one was set in the "then fashionable" design
known as Garamond; number two in Baskerville; numbers
three and four reverted to Caslon. When Mr. Stanley Morison
took over the editing of numbers five, six and seven, and the
printing moved from Curwen to Cambridge, the final volumes
were all set in Fournier.</p>

<p>It was about this same time that William Maxwell told Shaw
that his old Caslon plates were worn out and suggested complete
resettings in a new Standard Edition in large crown octavo in
small-pica Fournier 1-1/2-points leaded. In the final choice of type<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[Pg 391]</span>
for the Standard Edition, we detect again how Shaw trusted
William Maxwell's judgment and accepted his advice. No doubt
there was an improvement in readability over the original edition,
but my own feeling is that the Standard Edition, as at
present printed, has none of the evocative charm of the original
edition. It may be that the Sundour binding seems prosaic. But
Shaw, disgusted by the fading of his green covers, was converted
to Sundour by a Winterbottom director emphasizing that not
even the Indian sun could change it.</p>

<p>When Shaw first saw Maxwell's specimens for the new Standard
Edition in various type-faces, Caslon, Baskerville, Scotch
Roman, Old Style and Fournier amongst others, he replied, "I
like them all but I'll stick to Caslon until I die: and after I am
dead you can do what you like." Fortunately, Shaw is still alive
and the Standard Edition is in Fournier.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>I cross-examined William Maxwell closely and at some length
on this switch from Caslon to Fournier. His persuasive and
peculiar ability to get his own way, even in face of such a do-or-die
statement of Shaw's, must be remarked here. I am afraid,
however, the only light I can throw on this, the greatest typographical
conversion of all time, is that Maxwell himself is very
fond of Fournier italics. Maxwell is no hard-headed Scot. He
comes from the soft Hyperborean north, where the Gulf Stream
makes the fuchsias grow six feet high. When he confesses to an
affair with an elegant French type there isn't much chance for
even an Irish author, much less the English public, to break up
the "auld alliance." Thus Shaw's Standard Edition, now running
into some thirty-five volumes, began publication in Fournier in
1931 and has steadily reprinted in this type and format at intervals
ever since.</p>

<p>In an article on "Author and Printer" in the eleventh impression
of the ninth edition of Collins's <cite>Authors' and Printers' Dictionary</cite>
Dr. R. W. Chapman observes: "The prolixity of modern
writing, fostered by cheap paper and print, by the habit of making
books out of articles and lectures, by the use of typewriters
and stenographers, is a positive evil."</p>

<p class="pc1 small1 center">Shaw's meticulous proofreading is indicated by this

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[Pg 393]</span></p>
</div>

<p>Shaw's method, probably verging on the diabolical to Dr.
Chapman, is to write everything first in shorthand. A double-spaced
typescript then becomes his working copy, to be sent to
the printer only after careful emendation and revision, in Shaw's
always clear hand.</p>

<p>The manuscripts, typescripts, galley, page and final press
proofs, indeed the whole apparatus of the Shavian "workshop"
in William Maxwell's collection, show the great pains Shaw takes
in writing and revising before setting. His meticulous proof
reading is as characteristic as the clarity of his proof correction.
William Maxwell tells me that Shaw's first-proof corrections are
often heavy, sometimes involving considerable re-setting and
re-make-up. But wherever lengthy excisions or additions are
made in final proofs, Shaw is always careful to supply the exact
number of words; sometimes in shorter corrections counting individual
letters in substituted words in order to avoid over-running
and re-justification.</p>

<p>By all the standards of Horace Hart and Howard Collins, Shaw
would qualify as an admirable and expert author in the technical
aspect of his relations with his printer&mdash;except, perhaps, for Dr.
Chapman's scholarly strictures on prefatorial prolixity and diabolonian
authorship.</p>

<p>Shaw's plays are drafted in what he calls Author's Shorthand
(simplified Pitman); typed by his secretary; revised; printed;
and passed for press after two more revisions. For rehearsal, fifty
copies are struck off as "By a Fellow of the Royal Society of
Literature." If more are required they are "By Bernard Shaw."
These sets are "privately printed." Alterations and additions in
rehearsal and during the run of the play are incorporated as
final corrections before publication.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting Shaw exhibits in William Maxwell's
possession is the original of the filmscript of <cite>Pygmalion</cite>.
Shaw allowed no hand but his own on the scripts of his films.
The corrected copy of the play, with alterations in dialogue and
time scheme for the screen and the additional scenes and
sequences, is in itself remarkable visual evidence of Shaw's
nimble-witted inventiveness. Few playwrights at the age of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[Pg 394]</span>
eighty-five have tackled so successfully the transition into
another medium, cooperating with director and producer to
present in all its freshness and verve the authentic Shavian touch
on both sound-track and screen.</p>

<p>The original edition, the Limited Collected edition, the Standard
edition, form the bulk of Shaw's printed works; his printed
ephemera are not my concern here. There are, however, various
editions of what we might call out-of-the-run-plays-and-prefaces
books: <cite>The Intelligent Woman's Guide</cite>, <cite>Everybody's Political
What's What</cite>, the two-column quarto editions of the <cite>Prefaces</cite>
and <cite>The Complete Plays</cite>, the illustrated <cite>Black Girl</cite>, the illustrated
<cite>Good King Charles's Golden Days</cite> (there was also an
illustrated edition of <cite>Geneva</cite> printed by the Chiswick Press)
and the illustrated Penguin edition of <cite>Pygmalion</cite>. "Omnibus"
editions of the <cite>Plays and Prefaces</cite> have been published by Odhams,
cheap editions by Penguin; and <cite>Back to Methuselah</cite> by
the Oxford University Press in World's Classics. The Odhams
omnibus was reprinted from Shaw's plates; the Penguin editions
were re-set in Times.</p>

<p><cite>The Intelligent Woman</cite> was instructed in Caslon on a page
dimension decided by William Maxwell; a binding design by
Douglas Cockerell; and a four-colour half-tone jacket from an
original drawing by Eric Kennington of a nude female Intelligencer
looking down a well. She, needless to add, had a much
less shapely figure than the Black Girl.</p>

<p>The typography of <cite>The Intelligent Woman's Guide</cite> (1928)
is in the Caslon formula. We need only note in passing that the
drop initials at the beginning of chapters are tightly fitted and
spill over into the margins. The binding suggests that too much
Cockerell can spoil a trade binding. The jacket was regrettable:
the externals of this book seem out of character with the rest of
Shaw's production. A more acceptable popular edition, printed
from the same plates, with reduced margins in small demy
octavo, was published a year later in 1929.</p>

<p>The two-column edition of the <cite>Complete Plays</cite>, set in Scotch
Roman in quarto, is a skillful piece of book-making; a pleasant,
readable page, which William Maxwell can appropriate entirely
to his own credit. For size, weight and general colour the Scotch
Roman was eminently successful for all the plays in one volume,
not too heavy in the hand, in a format which makes for easy
reference and re-reading.</p>

<p>The contrast of the two-column Fournier setting of the <cite>Prefaces</cite>
with the two-column setting of the <cite>Complete Plays</cite> in
Scotch Roman is to the advantage of the Scotch Roman. The
small pica Fournier is too large in relation to the width of the
column and, to my eye, does not look at all happy in this two-column
setting.</p>

<p><cite>Everybody's Political What's What</cite> provides us with an interesting
example of the close collaboration in proof-reading between
William Maxwell, his press-readers and Shaw. Shaw, to
illustrate some argument, asserted erroneously that so many
codfish were being caught at one period that great quantities
were being thrown back into the sea. Maxwell pointed out that
codfish were never thrown back into the sea; they are salted,
dried, preserved and disposed of in many other ways. Shaw, hazy
about varieties, intended fish in general and not codfish in particular.</p>

<p>Also in this book, Shaw mentioned that when an outsider wins
a race, book-makers lose. William Maxwell, no mean expert in the
making of these other kinds of "books" and having absorbed, no
doubt, from Edward Clark some knowledge and appreciation
of "the sporting spirits," questioned this; and innumerable letters
from punters and bookies overloaded Shaw's letterbox. He
re-worded the passage to silence the rule-of-thumb practitioners.</p>

<p>We have all been afflicted from time to time in prefaces and
authors' notes with the names of odd people who have also "read
the proofs." There can be few authors who get the benefit of
skilled press-reading and skilled scrutiny from a managing director
so knowledgeable about fish and about "bookies." The codfish
and "bookie" stories are an interesting indication of how
every page of Shaw's goes through a double sieve at Brandon
Street, such is the passion of Scots for accuracy in type-setting.
The Scots' passion for perfection in press-work comes to light in
this association with the production of <cite>The Black Girl</cite>.</p>

<p>Some time prior to 1932, Shaw asked Maxwell to suggest an
engraver-illustrator for this Voltairean tale; Maxwell suggested
John Farleigh. With that thorough attention to detail characteristic
of the Scot, he not only ensured that Shaw should have
an illustrator capable of interpreting his ideas, he also took care
that the engravings, paper and ink should all be happily matched
and tested. By accepting full responsibility for the typography
of the illustrated page, he undoubtedly produced an illustrated
Shaw of a quality and at a price which was a credit to author
and printer.</p>

<p>My typographical feelings about <cite>The Black Girl</cite> are mixed.
The engravings seem rather too heavy for the Fournier setting;
it may be an odd observation to make about a Shaw book, but
the illustrations overload the text of this slim book; the binding
is too much and too black. Shaw's own wash drawings of the
Black Girl are much more subtle in suggestion than John Farleigh's
white line. But there was little doubt about the success
of <cite>The Black Girl</cite> with a large public. It is an interesting and
successful example of a short book with text and illustrations
printed at one impression, and without any complications in
binding.</p>

<p>The contrast between Farleigh's sharp white line and Topolski's
loose black squiggle in the illustrated edition of <cite>Good King
Charles's Golden Days</cite> demonstrates what I mean by the rigidity
of <cite>The Black Girl</cite> page. Shaw as an author is impossible to illustrate;
he can only be annotated and decorated. There is an engaging
light-hearted quality about Topolski's cosmopolitan
draughtsmanship which seems to suit Shaw better than Farleigh's
engravings.</p>

<p>Maxwell's earliest recollection of meeting Shaw is of going
to see Mrs. Shaw at the Adelphi about the printing of her translations
of some plays by Brieux, the author of <cite>Damaged Goods</cite>.
Shaw had written an introduction to them.</p>

<p>In the centenary letter to William Maxwell in November 1946,
Shaw wrote: "I remember Edward Clark very kindly and very
well; but it was with you that our business relations developed
into a cordial personal relationship which has been of inestimable
value to me as an author...."</p>

<p>William Maxwell at an early stage in his career became aware
of the printer's responsibility to the author. Clark's work for
Robert Louis Stevenson must often have been recollected and
discussed. Many other authors have passed through Brandon
Street on their way. It is one of the doubtful pleasures of a book-printing
establishment to deal direct with authors. Maxwell has
had his full share of that kind of mixed pleasure and responsibility
with Hardy, Kipling, the Webbs, Sir James Frazer, Hugh
Walpole, Virginia Woolf, Charles Morgan, Osbert and Edith
Sitwell.</p>

<p>I began with an Edinburgh book-printer; I conclude with an
honorary LL.D. of Edinburgh University. In 1947 that ancient
University conferred on William Maxwell that honour which
he values above any personal recognition. It was a deserved
compliment to R. &amp; R. Clark and to Scottish printing as a whole.</p>

<p>No man is self-made; but so far as any one individual can by
his own efforts raise the standard of his trade, the renown of his
firm and add to the lustre of his native city, Dr. William Maxwell
has done so by his devoted and sedulous years in the service of
many authors and many publishers....</p>

<p>This inadequate typographical report is in no sense intended
to be either accurate or inclusive. Nor do I make any claim for
startling innovations in graphic design or any particularly noteworthy
contributions to typography. This productive association
has covered fifty of the most inventive years in the mechanical
development of book-printing; Bernard Shaw himself wrote,
"I have not had to think about my printing. I have left it to do
itself, which means that R. &amp; R. Clark had to do it." All the same
he thought a lot about it.</p>

<p>I may well conclude with the final paragraph of Shaw's letter
to William Maxwell of November 1946. "Long may you and
R. &amp; R. Clark Ltd. flourish after we have said our last farewell
which we shall both, I hope, be still too busy to attend to."</p>

<cite><small>On Type Faces For Books</small></cite></h2>


<p>It is simple enough to understand that type, paper and ink are
components of book printing. But not so easy to comprehend the
reasons for the variety of papers available, nor the many dozens of
type faces offered for book composition.</p>

<p>The reasons for this great variety are partly functional, partly
aesthetic, and competitive. Papers differ in many ways&mdash;color, finish,
opacity, strength and bulk are some of them.</p>

<p>Type faces differ, too, and for equally valid reasons. There are
the important design and style differences that comprise the old
style, transitional and modern faces suitable for books. And distinctions
in weight or "color"; distinctions in roundness, in degree of
compactness, and distinctions in legibility, and in size.</p>

<p>To the designer of books, type face selection is important in relation
to the character of the text to be printed. The size of type selected,
and the amount of "leading," or space between its lines, has
a bearing upon the number of pages the manuscript will make.</p>

<p>Some shorter manuscripts, for instance, need to be "driven out"
or padded, to make the book appear greater in content than it actually
is, to justify its price. Others need every possible degree of compression
to get the manuscript into a lesser number of pages, which,
in turn, means fewer "forms" to print, fewer "signatures" to bind,
and less paper to use.</p>

<p>To turn from the functional use of type to the aesthetic, and also
make a rather loose analogy, one may think of the type face as a
garment with which the designer dresses the author's words.</p>

<p>In this instance the designer selects a type face to develop an
"allusive" format&mdash;to reflect something of the style of the period of
the manuscript. Bruce Rogers, the greatest master of allusive book-making,
in his "Paragraphs on Printing" points out that in a small way
this is "like planning the stage setting for a play.</p>

<p>"An up-to-date style for an ancient text would compare with
staging <cite>Hamlet</cite> in modern dress. However novel and effective in its
own way, you feel it to be strange, and this sense of strangeness is
an annoying distraction; you are forced to think of the setting and
the designer rather than the text."</p>

<p>It is easier to suggest a feminine appeal with types like Estienne
or Fairfield or Garamond, than with less decorative faces such as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[Pg 403]</span>
Baskerville, Bodoni or Janson. Yet it is foolish to go too far in this
direction. Strictly speaking, there are no definitely feminine or masculine
types&mdash;the way type is handled has much to do with the mood
it evokes. And it is dangerous to pin labels on types without knowing
a great deal of their background and derivation.</p>

<p>The idea of using many distinguished types for the composition
of this book was deliberate: The intent was to demonstrate, on a uniform
paper surface and under identical printing conditions, the
"behavior" of twenty of the finest types of our time.</p>

<p>And to afford a basis for comparison that might not only illumine
some of the points mentioned, but also provide reference specimens
of these notable book faces. To that end, a complete alphabet showing
in caps and lower-case of each face is included, with a brief
account of its background and development.</p>

<p>Not every essay will be equally appealing, typographically. Yet
the variety of faces used in setting them seems more successful than
would be the less sensitive treatment of uniform typography. Reading
the articles and studying the performance of the individual types
should provide an increased appreciation of the part typography
plays in developing the book's format.</p>

<p>In this present instance, the designer has chosen one basic "background"
face, Janson, for the majority of the essays. And has "interleaved,"
so to speak, many of the essays set in different types. This
treatment lessens any tendency toward uneven color and spottiness,
and minimizes some of the potential "scrap book" feel of many differing
type specimens.</p>

<p>The problem of coupling face with essay was carefully considered.
There could be none but the obvious selection of the author's
own design in connection with five of the essays: Electra for W. A.
Dwiggins' "Investigation into the Physical Properties of Books";
Perpetua for Eric Gill's "Typography"; Times Roman for Stanley
Morison's "First Principles of Typography"; Deepdene for Frederic
Goudy's "Types and Type Design"; and Centaur for the extracts
from Bruce Rogers' <cite>Paragraphs on Printing</cite>.</p>

<p>Some background on the type selections for other essays may be
of interest: Monticello, a recutting of one of the earliest American
types, was a natural and excellent choice for Lawrence Wroth's
"First Work with American Types," as was Bembo, one of Beatrice
Warde's favorite faces for her "Printing Should Be Invisible." Bell,
which Mr. Updike was one of the first to use with distinction&mdash;he
called it Mountjoye when he acquired it in 1903&mdash;was the choice for
his "Some Tendencies in Modern Typography."</p>

<p>The selection of Poliphilus for Sir Francis Meynell's "Some Collectors
Read" seemed appropriate in recognition of the many fine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[Pg 404]</span>
Nonesuch books he had set in English Monotype faces; while that
of Baskerville for John Winterich's essay on Franklin as printer and
publisher was because Baskerville was a type Franklin greatly admired.
Caledonia, an original Dwiggins face influenced by Scotch
Roman, was the more subtle choice for Scot printer James Shand's
revealing account of George Bernard Shaw's relations with his
printer&mdash;more appropriate to Shand's preference and background,
than would have been the choice of Caslon or Fournier, in which
Shaw's books have been set.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The brief mention of old style, transitional and modern faces may
need amplification. And also the descriptive terms Linotype and
Monotype, which are trade-marked words that indicate <em>methods</em> of
composition.</p>

<p>In <cite>Linotype</cite>, the product is an actual line of type, called "slug" in
printer's parlance. This is produced by one machine, from matrices
assembled through finger action on a keyboard. In operation, the
assembled line moves to the mold for casting and the matrices are then
returned (distributed) to their channels in the magazine for use in
other lines.</p>

<p>In <em>Monotype</em>, the product is individual pieces of type&mdash;letters and
spaces assembled into a line of many elements, as in hand type. The
Monotype machine consists of two units: the keyboard (which resembles
a type-writer) punches holes in a roll of paper, not unlike
that in a player piano. This roll is then fed into the casting unit, where
it functions by controlling levers which bring the matrix of each
character into position for casting letters and spaces in sequence in
the lines.</p>

<p>The distinctions between type faces called old style, transitional <em>or</em> modern,</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i404" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_404.jpg"  alt="" /></div>

<p>are apparent at a glance to the technician. Just as, for instance, you
distinguish instantly between a Scandinavian, a Latin-American, or
a Mongolian. Analysis may indicate that the chief factor in your
instant recognition of these types is memory of features.</p>

<p>So too in type faces. Here the differences are more minute, and
essentially a matter of design distinctions: the weight and relation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[Pg 405]</span>
of thick and thin strokes, the treatment and stress of curves, and
the handling of "serifs." There is little difference in the actual shapes
of letters, which is as it should be.</p>

<p>One of the more lucid accounts of the development of letter
forms is W. A. Dwiggins' "The Shapes of Roman Letters," included
in his <cite>Mss. by WAD</cite>. Illustrations from this minor classic are used
here by permission.</p>

<p>Remember that most of the letter forms we meet are modifications
of written letters, shaped by pen action. Some differences in the
details of serif treatment are indicated by these Dwiggins drawings:</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i405" style="max-width: 21.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_405.jpg"  alt="" />
<p><span style="padding-left: 1em"><em><strong>a</strong></em></span>  <span style="padding-left: 2em"><em><strong>b</strong></em></span>   <span style="padding-left: 8.5em"><em><strong>c</strong></em></span>  <span style="padding-left: 5.3em"><em><strong>d</strong></em></span></p>
</div>



<p><em>a</em> shows a commonly designed serif detail, much better handled by
natural pen action in <em>b</em>. The arch of a letter, frequently handled in
type as <em>c</em>, is more crisp and attractive in <em>d</em>, the natural pen form.</p>

<p>In type, serifs help carry the eye in a horizontal direction, a designer
friend points out, setting up a "flow" from letter to letter
within the word, and from word to word across the line.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i405-3" style="max-width: 10.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_405-3.jpg"  alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span style="padding-left: 2em"><em>e</em></span> <span style="padding-left: 5.5em"><em>f</em></span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Contrast the "degenerate, commonly used" form of o shown in <em>e</em>,
with the more attractive pen form in <em>f</em>. Here is graphic distinction
in the treatment and stress of curves.</p>

<p>The two most common classes of type faces are "old style" and
"modern." The "transitional," a merging of the old style form into
the modern&mdash;is typified by the illustration of Bulmer, between the
Janson and Bodoni specimens used for the visual presentation on
page 404.</p>

<p>Our old style faces descend from the early Italian Roman types
and differ in minor details and "national" characteristics. Among the
old style faces used in this book are Bembo and Centaur, which reflect
the Italian form; Estienne, Granjon and Garamond, which reflect
the French form; Caslon and Janson, typical of the English-Dutch
form; and Fairfield and Times Roman, as differing expressions of
contemporary old style types.</p>

<p>Modern faces, the result of a swing of taste in the opposite direction,
stemmed from an effort to copy in type the letters of eighteenth-century
copper-plate engravers. Bodoni, the classic form of the
modern, is included in its lighter rendering, named Bodoni Book.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[Pg 406]</span>
The first English modern, named Bell, is also included; together with
two contemporary moderns, the Dwiggins-designed Electra and
Caledonia faces, cut by Linotype. All three are less severe than
Bodoni and retain elements of the transitional form in some letters.</p>

<p>The two really transitional faces included are the classic Baskerville,
and Monticello, which verges somewhat more to the old style
character.</p>

<p>"Letters," as Mr. Dwiggins illustrates graphically, "are made out
of thick 'stems,' thin 'hair-lines,' loops and 'serifs,' or finishing
strokes."</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i406-1" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_406-1.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>How the variations that produce the different styles of Roman
types actually came about is easily understood by seeing how the
nib of the pen is slanted to write an old style letter like Caslon (<em>g</em>),
as against holding it at right angles to the written line for the modern
letter, such as Scotch (<em>h</em>):</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i406-2" style="max-width: 16.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_406-2.jpg"  alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span style="padding-left: 3em"><em>g</em></span> <span style="padding-left: 9em"><em>h</em></span></p></div>
</div>



<p>Differences in curve and finish are a natural result of these two pen
positions.</p>

<p>As Mr. Dwiggins explains: "In writing lower-case 'a,' for example,
the stroke begins at the little bulb at the upper left-hand
corner, passes over the arch at the top, descends to form the straight
stem, and finishes with an upward flick; a second motion forms the
loop. As the line moves, it swells and thins in accordance with the
shape of the pen and the direction of the movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[Pg 407]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i407-1" style="max-width: 6.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_407-1.jpg"  alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span style="padding-left: 2em"><em>i</em></span>  <span style="padding-left: 2em"><em>j</em></span></p></div>
</div>




<p>"In the Caslon letter (<em>i</em>), the swelling at the top begins at the
bulb or dot; the arch expands throughout its whole curve; the loop
has a decided tilt, as has the finishing stroke.</p>

<p>"In the Scotch letter (<em>j</em>), the arch is a thin line; the expansion does
not begin until the downward stroke of the stem; the swelling of the
loop is at right angles to the line of writing, and the letter ends with
a perpendicular flick.</p>

<p>"In the 'b,' one notices the difference in the loops and in the serifs
at the tops of the letters.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp83" id="i407-2" style="max-width: 4.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_407-2.jpg"  alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span style="padding-left: 1.5em"><em>k</em></span>  <span style="padding-left: 1.6em"><em>l</em></span></p></div>
</div>


<p>"The typical 'old style' serif at the top (<em>k</em>) tilts as the pen is tilted;
the loop is a tilted sweep of the slanted pen; while the serif and loop
of the 'modern' letter (<em>l</em>) partake of the perpendicular position of
the pen. These characteristics of tilt or perpendicularity appear in all
the lower-case letters and to a limited extent in the capitals."</p>

<p>To check the distinctions in different characters in the following
twenty types, a magnifying glass will be helpful.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[Pg 408]</span></p>
<p>"The artistic quality of a type letter," Mr. Dwiggins concludes,
"is determined by its degree of grace of line and proportion. The
standards of grace and proportion are to be looked for in the natural
motions of the pen. But the quality called art is dependent, too, upon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[Pg 409]</span>
the artist's appreciation of the material in which he works&mdash;namely
metal. The draughtsman does not attempt to copy <em>exactly</em> the form
of his pen-written model, but modifies the pen form to a shape suitable
to its final state&mdash;that of a metal punch."</p>

<p>BASKERVILLE, the fine transitional face named for the eighteenth-century
English printer, is available in several contemporary
versions. The Linotype cutting used here, most faithful to the original
Roman, was produced from a complete font cast from the original
matrices, exhumed at Paris in 1929. For twenty years Baskerville has
been a favored type with American book-makers.</p>

<p>BELL, the fine English transitional-modern, was cut by Richard Austin
about 1788 for John Bell, a leading English book and newspaper publisher.
The English Monotype version used here was reproduced in 1931 from
the original punches, then in possession of the Stephenson-Blake foundry
in Sheffield. Bruce Rogers used the type (calling it Brimmer) for many
fine Riverside Press books.</p>

<p>BEMBO, the fine Venetian old face, is a revival by English Monotype of one of
the earliest Aldine romans. That was cut before 1500 by Francesco Griffo of
Bologna, the designer responsible for the first Italic type a half-dozen years later,
and named for Pietro Bembo, the humanist scholar (later Cardinal and secretary
to Pope Leo X), whose <cite>De Aetna</cite> was printed by Aldus in 1495.</p>

<p>BODONI BOOK, a light weight rendering of the popular A.T.F.
Bodoni, is widely used in the United States for book and periodical
composition. Introduced in 1910, it is not a copy of the types of the
great Italian, Giambattista Bodoni, but rather a version retaining his
principle of modern letter design. The lessened degree of contrast between
its thick and thin lines make it gain in reading ease.</p>

<p>CALEDONIA, a contemporary Linotype face designed by W. A.
Dwiggins, was inspired by the work of Scotch type-founders, in
particular by a lighter weight, more slender transitional face cut by
William Martin for Bulmer around 1790. Christened for its forebears,
Caledonia resembles neither&mdash;though it has touches of both Bulmer's
Martin and Wilson's Scotch, and also "something of the simple, hard-working,
feet-on-the-ground quality of Scotch Modern."</p>

<p>CASLON, the great eighteenth-century English old style, has suffered
more from "improvement and refinement" by succeeding generations
of type founders than most celebrated types. A development
based on Dutch models rather than an original creation, Caslon has
been eloquently termed "the finest vehicle for the printed conveyance
of English speech that the art of the punch-cutter has yet devised."
Monotype's excellent rendering used here (No. 337) reflects the essential
qualities of the original.</p>

<p>CENTAUR, a distinguished Italian Renaissance face designed
by Bruce Rogers, was cut by Robert Wiebking of
Chicago in 1914, in the 14 point size. Its first use by BR
was in a limited edition of De Guerin's <cite>The Centaur</cite>, printed
at Carl Rollins' Montague Press. The face, recut by English
Monotype in 1929, seemed to D. B. Updike to be "one of
the best Roman founts yet designed in America." The Italic

<p>DEEPDENE, designed and cut by Frederic W. Goudy in 1927, was named for
his estate at Marlboro-on-Hudson. In his <cite>A Half Century of Type Design</cite>, Mr. Goudy
mentions the face was "suggested by a Dutch type (the Lutetia of Van Krimpen)
which had just been introduced ... but as with some of my previous designs, I soon
got away from my exemplar to follow a line of my own." The Monotype recutting,
done later, is used here.</p>

<p>ELDORADO, the latest Linotype face designed by W. A. Dwiggins,
was developed through the war years and completed in 1951. It
was suggested by an uncommonly compact and distinctive eighteenth-century
face used in Madrid by the Spanish printer, DeSancha. In no
sense a copy, Eldorado retains in its letter anatomy something of the
treatment of curves, arches and junctions that brought distinction to
its antecedent, as well as flavor of Spanish typographic tradition.</p>

<p>ELECTRA, an original modern, designed for Linotype by W. A.
Dwiggins, reflects the warmth and distinction of his personal lettering.
The effort was to work into Electra letter shapes, where possible,
some of the twentieth-century spirit: electricity, high-speed steel,
streamlined curves, the readers' familiarity with newspaper and type-writer
faces ... to develop letters filled with energy, human warmth
and personality. Electra is available with either an oblique Roman
lower-case companion form, or the more familiar cursive.</p>

<p>EMERSON was designed by Joseph Blumenthal and cut by Monotype in
England in 1934. The face is a duplicate of his Spiral Press type, designed
several years earlier and cut for him by Louis Hoell in Frankfort, Germany, in
1931. This face was initially used for a limited edition of Ralph Waldo Emerson's
essay on <cite>Nature</cite>, printed on a hand press at Croton Falls in 1932, and
privately published. The accompanying Emerson Italic was designed in 1936.</p>

<p>FAIRFIELD, a slightly decorative, original and contemporary old style,
was designed for Linotype by Rudolph Ruzicka, the distinguished American
wood engraver. Sharply cut, as though the letters came from the
artist's graver rather than pen, Fairfield was designed for reading by "one
of the most knowledgeable men in the country about letter forms and
their style." To invite continuous reading, the designer feels, "type must
have a subtle degree of interest and variety of design."</p>

<p>GARAMOND was introduced in America by ATF in 1919, when their
cutting, based on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">caractères de l'Université</i> of the Imprimerie Nationale,
appeared. Since, at least eight other versions have been made: by the English
and American Linotype and Monotype, by Intertype, Ludlow, and the
Stempel foundry. A documented article considering the XVI and XVII
sources of the Garamond types, by Paul Beaujon, appeared in <cite>The Fleuron</cite>,
V. This version is the American Monotype.</p>

<p>GILL SANS, designed by Eric Gill in 1928, was patterned after lettering
done for the Douglas Cleverdon book-shop in Bristol. First offered by
English Monotype as a titling font (caps, figures and points only), the
lower-case was added as the face grew in favor. Today, Gill is the most
popular sans serif in England. It ranges through a variety of weights,
including light, normal, heavy, extra heavy, and shadow and outline
display and condensed versions.</p>

<p>GRANJON was designed for Linotype by the late George W. Jones, one
of England's greatest printers. It is neither a copy of a classic face nor an
original creation, but rather something between the two, with its basic design
stemming from classic Garamond sources. An exceedingly compact and
useful old style, Granjon is exceptionally clear in small sizes. Its space-saving
virtues are important in the book and periodical field.</p>

<p>JANSON, the distinguished seventeenth-century old style face, is
presumed Dutch in origin. It was issued by Anton Janson, a Leipsic
punch-cutter and type-founder, between 1660 and 1687. Little is
known of Janson to supplement his first type specimen issued in
1675. The original matrices, bought in Holland from the heirs of
Edling, Janson's successor, are possessed by the Stempel foundry in
Frankfort, Germany. The Linotype recutting of Janson was made
from type cast from the original matrices.</p>

<p>MONTICELLO is a recutting of the famous Binny &amp; Ronaldson
Roman No. 1, a distinguished early American face cut in 1796 in
Philadelphia. Type cast from the original matrices by A. T. F. has
been favored for years by such discriminating printers as D. B.
Updike, Fred Anthoensen and the Grabhorns. Linotype's remodeling
of the type for modern use was named for the <cite>Papers of Thomas
Jefferson</cite>, a fifty-volume publishing project by Princeton, for which
the face was adopted.</p>

<p>PERPETUA was designed by Eric Gill, the eminent English sculptor and maker of
letters with pen, chisel and graver. Mr. Gill's account of his type (cut in England):
"from drawings made by me. Those drawings were not made with special reference
to typography&mdash;they were simply drawn with brush and ink. For the typographical
quality of the fount, as also for the remarkably fine and precise cutting of the
punches, the Monotype Corporation is to be praised."</p>

<p>POLIPHILUS is a literal reproduction of the Aldine Roman used in the <cite>Hypnerotomachia
Poliphili</cite> in 1499, cut by Francesco Griffo. The recutting, by the English Monotype
organization in 1923 (from sheets of the book) was attempted with the thought of
providing a type to convey an old-world atmosphere appropriate for reprinting fifteenth-century
classics. The accompanying Italic, named <em>Blado</em>, was the first of a number of
Chancery italics to come from European type-founders.</p>

<p>TIMES ROMAN was designed by Stanley Morison for the London
<cite>Times</cite>, and first used in that great newspaper. Its masculine simplicity,
directness of design and excellent color makes it exceptionally useful for
periodicals and general commercial work. The basic design objective of
maximum legibility in minimum space has resulted in the larger letter-structure
that makes each point size seem the equivalent of a size larger
in most other types.</p>

Produced by Tim Lindell, Stephen Rowland, Lis, Gen Knit, Andrés Galia
Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
